	Healthy adults raising children from infancy seems to naturally inhibit later sexual interaction between them.
    <span style="background-color: #FEFFD5">The instinctual incest taboo<i> is
	</i>weaker in typical stepfamilies</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">.</span>
    Attraction and sexual behavior between a stepparent and an alluring stepteen or between
    adolescent stepsibs isn't probable, but 
	it <i>is</i> more likely than in a typical healthy
    intact biofamily. Recent research suggests that American girls under 18 are four times more likely to
    be sexually abused by a male step-relative than a male bio-relative.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 6px"><font face="Arial" size="2">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So: thoughtful co-parental modeling, sexual guidance, and enforcement of personal modesty and privacy rules
    are specially important in stepfamily homes. 
	<span style="background-color: #F0F0F0"><u>Note</u>: 
	co-parents and supporters can get distracted or conflicted by debating what

	- in general, and in their stepfamily. The issue is not semantic labels, but 
	co-parents' admitting and controlling family-members' sexual attitudes and 
	behaviors that harm or upset each other, and lower 
	their stepfamily's 
	nurturance level.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 6px"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courting 
or newly-cohabiting co-parenting couples should generally avoid being overtly sexual in front of their minor kids,
    specially within se-veral years of biofamily separation. Seeing their parent and a
    &quot;strange&quot; adult sexually kissing or touching can evoke intense feelings of
    disgust, outrage, resentment, and guilt in a pre-teen or 
adolescent biochild who hasn't had a chance to 
grieve and/or to adjust to
    their own sexuality. This is specially true if the child has protectively allied with
    a bioparent who is psychologically &quot;still married&quot; - i.e. hasn't 
mourned (admitted and accepted) their divorce 
losses.</font></p>
