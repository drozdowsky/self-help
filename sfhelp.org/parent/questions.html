	bills and banks to deposit money etc on a bus all the time etc. Leave no 
	food for u at home and go out for parties without telling when u return from 
	college?<br>
	<br>
	2. and his wife moans about you not doing chores and cooking when u go to 
	college monday to friday (full time) and work sat and sun for 20 hours? u 
	cant watch tv cos they never leave it even if they have a spare switched off 
	in their room?<br>

	4. <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">I lost my father 12 years ago</span>. brother called me abroad to finish

	rent.<br>
	<br>
	I can only work 20 hours which I am already. He tells mom I spend money on 
	shopping thats why I dont have money to pay him rent and bills. I am not 
	allowed to go any-where after college cos I should be home cooking and 
	cleaning for them. How cool is that?<br>
	<br>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">My mother is also not helping</span>. she wants me to give her some money every

								<span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
								For the past year and 6 months I have suffered 
								from depression. I have isolated myself from the 
								world. I havent gone to a professional and been 
								diagnosed but I am showing almost every symptom 
								of depression and every depression test I could 
								find has said that I have depression. For the 
								past 6 months I thought it was minor but in the 
								past 2 months I have began to release how severe 
								it is. 5 months ago I started thinking about 
								commiting a school shooting. previously I had 
								thought about suicide and running away as well. 
								The shooting idea was at the back of my mind 
								until last month when it resurfaced. This time it 
								started to become all in could think about. I 
								spent hours just thinking and plotting. I 
								researched countless shootings and analysed how 
								they went down. In school all I did was just 
								think and plan. <br>
								<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a website in which a person had done a study of 22 
								shootings and created a common profile of the 
								shooters. A recipe of what goes in to creating a 
								shooter. I compared my symptoms and myself to the 
								profile and I matched almost every similarity 
								these shooters had. <br>
								<br>
								#1. Depression present with action equivalents- 
								mixed personality disorder with paranoid, 
								antisocial and narcissistic features.<br>
								<br>
								a) Narcissistic: I never thought about this 
								feature or realized that I had any narcissistic 
								features in development until recently. Ill 
								explain why later but because of the stuff thats 
								recently happened (Read the whole question) I 
								feel like im special and like god has given me 
								special powers.<br>
								<br>
								Antisocial: I think I may have social anxiety. I 
								dont talk to people but its almost as if ive 
								forgotten how to talk to people. I just stand 
								there awkwardly. I think this was first 
								trigerred be my self esteem issues.<br>
								<br>
								Paranoid: Im showing signs.<br>
								<br>
								#2. I am a kid who is somewhere near the bottom 
								of the social ladder. Popular people are nice to 
								me but I dont communicate back.<br>
								<br>
								#3. Gender identity and sexuality: I am an 
								effeminite person. I wear light make up, when I 
								was younger I wanted to wear nail polish and 
								other stuff. I think my dad is homophobic and he 
								was mad when I painted my nails when I was 5. I 
								think I may be developing bisexual traits but im 
								not sure. many shooters were in a way effeminite 
								but were masaginysts. I understand why this is. 
								Also, I dont do well in sports sometimes like 
								some of the people in my class and in some 
								respcts dont fit the male profile. manly, tough 
								and brave.<br>
								<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Im gonna skip the rest of the steps but if you would like to 
								see the website its in added details<br>
								<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway. For the past month ive been noticing some stuff. I 
								had a facebook converstaion with this girl in my 
								class. At that time I didnt really know her. She 
								really seemed to care and that converstaion made 
								me feel better. A few days latr I had this 
								daydream of her or one of her friends getting 
								her period in april. I know it sounds weird. But 
								in the past I was able to predict what song was 
								about to play on my ipod sometimes. It may be 
								coincidence but I see it differently and that 
								may contribute to the narcissim. also, when you 
								are suicidal you apparently notice alot of 
								coincidences. anyway I noticed alot of other 
								stuff as well. There was thsi presentation with 
								no name but I knew whos it was and I was right. 
								The word ulladulla popped into my head and the 
								next day there was a big poster with the word on 
								it. I heard a voice in my head that sounded like 
								one of y teachers that said &quot;+*my name* I 
								am going to tell you something strange. today I 
								had this facebook conversation with this kid. I 
								knew him last year and my friends teased him. We 
								chatted and I saw myself in him. A kid who was 
								alone and sad. He had it alot worse than I do 
								and I started to think about the point of a 
								school shooting. I think all of thsi stuff 
								happening is like a sign that I shouldnt go 
								through with this. I also had another 
								conversation with the girl on facebook. Im 
								starting to like her but in a big sister/mother 
								figure kind of way which is a little weird. <br>
								<br>
								Anyway....Im not sure how to approach this and 
								what the next step is going to be. I have a 
								plane and opportunity to shoot up my school but 
								I feel as if god is trying to stop me. I dont 
								know what to do. Help me make the right choice</span></font></i></div>

									<br>
									- Sexual urges<br>
									- Fear of people when they get angry<br>
									- Crying for inconsequential reasons<br>
									- Having the urge/addiction to lie about

									- Getting sexually aroused very easily<br>
									- Low self esteem<br>
									- Bad social skills<br>
									- Being somewhat suicidal<br>

														but I am an exeception 
														to the rule. I am no

														good things and is a 
														good person but she is a 
														demon as well. I still 
														live with her due to 
														economy and no promotion 
														at my job. Don't mention 
														military because I been 
														there done that. They 
														tossed me back home. I 
														wanted to stay.<br><br>I am a man and am not 
														afraid. Noone believed 
														me nor had my side. I'm

														My older brother would 
														join in the saddistic

														currently unemployed and 
														has no skills and has 
														been for almost 3 years. 
														HE IS A DEMON.<br><br>I have a serial killer's 
														childhood yet I did not 
														and refuse to turn out 
														like that. I never had a 
														girlfriend nor am I 
														really permitted to have 
														one. Not really. I know 
														my mother for what she 
														TRUELY is. I love her 
														and feel sorry for her 
														for what she had to go 
														through in life. Losing 
														two husbands. My dad to 
														lung cancer which to 
														this day, accuses me of 
														not caring enough 
														depsite I was 10 when it 
														happened. I loved him 
														too. He was a bully at 
														times and joined in. I 
														hate him and am glad he 
														is gone. I'm sorry he is 
														dead and I love him but 
														hate him. My step dad 
														which I think was 
														P-</font>whipped, I never 
														really knew him. Only 
														together 2 years and he 
														seemed like a nice man, 
														dropped dead one night 
														of a heart attack.<br>
													<br><font face="Arial">My mom seems to enjoy 
														laying into me about 
														whatever. This is the 
														type of person who wants 
														the government to 
														protect us and agrees 
														everything the law says 
														while I see flaws in the 
														law system as I am a 
														criminal justice student 
														and see nothing but lies 
														and corruption. I want 
														the right to bare arms. 
														My mom thinks noone 
														should ever carry and 
														the world be safer. I 
														disagree. If Jack the 
														Ripper came into my 
														home, I'd want to 
														protect my loved ones 
														and family. Yet I would 
														go to jail for it. 
														Double standards are bad 
														for you. Someone told me 
														to go to hell once and I 
														said I'm already there.<br>
													<br>Guilt trips, 
														manipulations, and 
														emotional scarring. My 
														mom manipulated people 
														into thinking I hit her 
														which is NOT TRUE. I 
														fail at life and don't 
														want to be here no more. 
														Ladies out there, I am a 
														good looking guy who 
														likes you all so much 
														that I don't want to 
														expose you to the 
														madness that is me. I am 
														not evil nor evil 
														natured. I was told that 
														I had the devil in me 
														when I was young. Ugly. 
														STUPID!! It's ok for 
														others to hit me and 
														step on me and I have no 
														rights. I am 29 now and 
														have been dying all my 
														life and want it to end.

									The memory of this scares me, because I now

									I've made the wrong decisions, and chose

									as if I'm stuck in life, and each time I 
									attend college, I get struck with horrible,

									experience than life itself, without being 
									lonely and loathing my own life. I feel 
									ashamed of my own existance. My aspirations 
									are now dead, and I don;'t know what I'm

															<div class="content">
															<font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">It seems like 
																they could 
																because they are 
																depressed 
																individuals 
																often wanting to 
																appear as better 
																then they 
																already are. I 
																suffer from this 
																disorder I 
																think. I am 
																often isolate 
																myself from 
																social contact 
																in a depressive 
																fantasy state 
																and often trying 
																to mimic the 
																social skills of 
																other to create 
																a superficial 
																charm to help me 
																along in the 
																real world. I am 
																often scared of 
																people out of 
																occurrences from 
																my past when 
																dealing with 
																people. I dealt 
																with a lot of 2 
																faced people and 
																they made me 
																scared to 
																interact with 
																anyone with my 
																TRUE self. So I 
																make myself have 
																a new roll that 
																I gained from 
																watching 
																someone, I 
																mimmick there 
																social skills 
																and use them 
																while typically 
																lieing and 
																making myself 
																seem higher then 
																I already am. 
																But when I'm 
																around to many 
																people the 
																depression 
																starts to come 
																back and my real 
																self starts to 
																show, often when 
																the conversation 
																arouses to 
																depressing 
																topics. Its like 
																the wolfman when 
																he has to leave 
																because there is 
																a full moon 
																outside, I am 
																the same way 
																when my real 
																self starts to 
																fluster. So I 
																often avoid 
																depressing 
																situations or 
																act insincere 
																and move on to 
																another upbeat 
																person. I took 
																myself out of a 
																real high school 
																because of this, 
																because I hated 
																that you had to 
																deal with 
																atleast 1 mean 
																person, or 
																jealous person 
																and how they can 
																really bring 
																down your life 
																in a situation. 
																So I chose home 
																schooling 
																online, with 
																very little 
																social 
																interaction. But 
																I do not desire 
																to get help, 
																because for most 
																of the time, its 
																kind of fun 
																maintaining 
																multiple 
																personalities 
																around different 
																people. You also 
																stay covert so 
																whenever you do 
																deal with a 2 
																faced person, he 
																has nothing to 
																exploit except a 
																lie while you 
																hold all the 
																secrets that 
																they told you.</font><div id="yan15">

															<font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
																I've always felt 
																so desperately 
																alone and 
																useless. I have 
																been unable to 
																sleep for as 
																long as I can 
																remember, so I 
																am tired 
																constantly and 
																have never had 
																any energy. For 
																over a decade I 
																just kept 
																fighting it and 
																doing what you 
																are supposed to. 
																Get some 
																education, get a 
																good job, buy a 
																house, buy a 
																car, be 
																responsible in 
																every possible 
																way. I've always 
																tried to help 
																other people 
																whenever they 
																need it, but am 
																unable to ask 
																others for help. 
																Through all of 
																this I was 
																somewhat at 
																peace with being 
																alone because I 
																didn't know any 
																different. Then 
																somehow I got an 
																amazing 
																girlfriend and 
																fell in love. 
																Thought we would 
																get married and 
																be happy. We 
																were together 
																for over 3 
																years, and then 
																she let me know 
																she felt 
																something was 
																missing, which 
																was causing 
																doubts for her, 
																so we broke up. 
																Now I feel more 
																alone than ever 
																before and am 
																right at the end 
																of my rope. Now 
																I know what it 
																is to be loved 
																and can't stand 
																the thought of 
																going on alone. 
																This isn't about 
																losing the 
																relationship, 
																it's about 
																losing what I 
																thought I would 
																never have and 
																feeling 
																completely 
																alone, useless 
																and tired of the 
																pain of daily 
																living. I've 
																tried taking my 
																mind off of it. 
																I go to the gym 
																every day, but 
																feel no better, 
																no healthier and 
																no more 
																distracted. I've 
																picked up a new 
																hobby that I've 
																always wanted to 
																do since I was a 
																kid. Over the 
																holidays I threw 
																myself into it 
																as much as 
																possible, but 
																again, it didn't 
																distract me, and 
																doesn't really 
																make me feel any 
																better. I've 
																tried going to 
																museums, parks 
																and just for 
																walks around the 
																neighbourhood. 
																I've gone to 
																doctors and had 
																many tests done 
																and been given 
																anti-depressants 
																and sleeping 
																pills. Neither 
																have done 
																anything. I had 
																one pill that 
																actually allowed 
																me to fall 
																asleep a little 
																quicker, but 
																still never woke 
																up feeling 
																refreshed or 
																energized. I 
																used to eat a 
																fair bit (wasn't 
																fat, but still 
																ate a fair bit), 
																but now my 
																stomach is 
																always tied up 
																in knots and 
																eating is 
																difficult 
																because I feel 
																terrible all the 
																time. I eat much 
																less and 
																generally 
																healthier trying 
																to feel better, 
																but it doesn't 
																appear to be 
																working. I'm out 
																of ideas and 
																energy to try

														<font style="font-size: 11pt">I've always been 
															really shy and I've 
															never liked how I 
															look.<br>But over the years, 
															my opinion of my 
															appearance has 
															gotten worse and 
															worse. I can't stand 
															what I see in the 
															mirror. And I want 
															to cry if someone 
															takes a photo of me. 
															I don't even like 
															people looking at 
															me. I get moody with 
															people if I think 
															they're staring at 
															me, and if I know 
															them well, I'll tell 
															them to stop looking 
															at me. I'm always 
															trying to hide my 
															face with my hands 
															and my hair. I can't 
															leave the house 
															without make-up and 
															I don't even like my 
															own parents seeing 
															me without any on. 
															I'm not saying I 
															slap on tons of it, 
															I'm only 15 
															(although I'm 16 
															soon), but I wear a 
															fair amount...<br>I hate my freckles. 
															So much. Them and 
															the REALLY dark 
															circles under my 
															eyes are my biggest 
															insecurities. Also, 
															I have huge ears. I 
															used to get bullied 
															because of them. But 
															I've been bullied my 
															entire life anyway, 
															and even though I've 
															left school now, I'm 
															still being bullied.<br>I've never been 
															really liked by 
															anyone (as in more 
															than a friend) or 
															been kissed and I 
															know you're thinking 
															'oh but you're only 
															15/16' but come on, 
															really, this is 
															2011. And it'd just 
															be nice to know I 
															actually have 
															someone seeing as I 
															only have like 2 
															friends.<br>I really do believe 
															people don't like me 
															because of how I 
															look. I think people 
															like attractive 
															people, and that I'm 
															not attractive 
															enough for the 
															world.<br>Sometimes how I feel 
															about my appearance 
															gets as bad to the 
															point where I really 
															do want to die 
															because of it. I get 
															depression anyway, 
															but most of it is 
															because of this.<br>
														<br>I have problems 
															talking to people 
															and I never talk 
															about personal 
															problems to anyone I 
															know (or a 
															therapist) and it's 
															something I cannot 
															do. At all.<br><br>I decided to briefly 
															tell my closest 
															friend a couple of 
															weeks ago. She said 
															that she honestly 
															thinks every time 
															she sees me that I'm 
															'amazingly 
															stunning'. I know 
															she's lying. Because 
															I have eyes too and 
															I can see my 
															reflection. And what 
															I see is the 
															complete opposite to 
															that.<br><br>I won't even leave 
															the house most of 
															the time.<br><br>It's just completely 
															destroying me. And I 
															don't know what to 
															do. I'm obsessed 
															with looks.<br><br>Advice would be 
															greatly 
															appreciated.....
