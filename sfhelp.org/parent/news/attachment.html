	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The quality of love a mother gives during her child’s first years of life 
	has a tremendous and long-term impact on that youngster</span>. A life that could 
	be described as emotionally healthy, happy, harmonious, constructive, and 
	productive depends on the quality of maternal love received at an early age. 
	</span></p>
	<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a fact well known by psychologists. Unfortunately, however, many 
	parents remain unaware of the importance of maternal love for the very young 
	child. Nor are they aware of the problems that can result during childhood 
	and adolescence if an infant does not form a proper early attachment.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, we 
	look at what attachment theory (Ainsworth 1978; Bowlby 1969) tells us about 
	the importance of early relationships for the development of an individual’s 
	basic sense of security in life. <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">By <em>attachment</em>, we mean the 
	relationship formed between the infant and the primary caregiver.</span> A primary 
	caregiver is the person, usually the mother, with whom the infant most 
	frequently interacts. Through bonding with this caregiver, a child develops 
	expectations about the extent to which he or she can acquire and maintain 
	secure relationships, as well as beliefs about others’ trustworthiness in 
	relationships.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	relationship between an infant and its mother can lead to two possible 
	outcomes: secure attachment or insecure attachment. In other words, the 
	experience can be positive or negative. Let’s look first at the positive 
	outcome.</span></p>
	<h3><span style="font-size: 11pt">Development of Secure Attachment</span></h3>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An infant 
	develops a secure attachment when its mother sensitively and appropriately 
	meets the child’s needs. From an infant’s perspective, sensitive and 
	appropriate mean the mother observes and understands its needs. Sensitive 
	and appropriate also mean the mother responds in ways that please and 
	satisfy her child. <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">A mother who fosters her child’s secure attachment meets 
	all needs soon after the child begins to show distress</span> or cries. The 
	mother’s behavior is always tender and affectionate. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure 
	attachment is also created when the mother holds or cuddles her infant and 
	toddler in ways that are comforting. The mother reflects the infant’s 
	behaviors and responds in ways the child enjoys. For example, when the baby 
	smiles, the mother smiles at the infant. The infant shows pleasure and 
	interest in the mother’s smile. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother 
	who fosters secure attachment is in tune with her child. An ongoing, 
	interactive harmony develops as the mother learns to understand, interpret, 
	and then appropriately react to the child’s behavior. She successfully 
	communicates to her youngster that the child’s behavior is respected, 
	interesting, and significant to her. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when an infant babbles, 
	makes sounds or syllables, or begins to talk, the mother notices these new 
	verbal abilities and responds in ways that lets the toddler feel valued. The 
	acquisition of speech is greatly facilitated when a mother holds, smiles at, 
	and talks to her infant (Bus &amp; van Ijzendoorn, 1988). </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infants and 
	toddlers love to explore and play. Mothers who wish to foster security in a 
	young child provide toys and activities in which the child expresses 
	interest. Because infants, toddlers, and preschoolers enjoy making choices, 
	parents who want their child to feel secure provide opportunities to make 
	choices throughout the day. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These mothers also allow the amount of playtime 
	the youngster wants. Without interrupting, they allow the child to focus on 
	an activity the child finds interesting, and do not distract the child until 
	he or she becomes bored with that activity.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Mothers 
	desirous of having their child form a secure bond with them also evaluate 
	their own childrearing behaviors</span>. They do this by paying attention to the 
	child’s reactions to them. If at any point the child becomes distressed or 
	acts out or displays insecure behavior, the mother does not blame the child. 
	Rather, the mother looks to her own behavior and adjusts it to provide 
	greater security and unconditional love. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	childrearing behaviors described here allow an infant or toddler to feel 
	secure. These behaviors also build a foundation of social harmony between 
	child and mother. The child enjoys being with the mother, and the mother 
	enjoys being with the child. The way an infant reacts to the mother reveals 
	whether the child feels his or her needs have been met in ways that are 
	pleasing. Contrary to popular belief, this kind of parenting will not spoil 
	a child. In fact, spoiled, dependent, misbehaving, and demanding children 
	are created when parents consistently violate these childrearing practices.</span></p>
	<h3><span style="font-size: 11pt">Development of Insecure Attachment</span></h3>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">When 
	maternal love is not consistently forthcoming, an infant develops an 
	insecure attachment</span>. In this case, the bonding with its primary caregiver is 
	incomplete and unsatisfactory. For example, when the infant cries or shows 
	distress or expresses a need, the mother does not respond, or only responds 
	after a significant delay. 
	</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother may act in loud, abrupt, or 
	exaggerated ways that scare the youngster and cause insecurity. The mother 
	does not spend time holding and cuddling her infant or child. She does not 
	regularly play with, talk to, or exchange smiles with the child. Instead, 
	the mother may attempt to impose her own interests on the child, such as by 
	providing toys and activities of her own choosing. 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">In general, none of the 
	intimate behaviors that occur during secure bonding happen</span>, or these 
	behaviors happen so infrequently that they are not noticed by the child.
	</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, 
	the child becomes frustrated because his or her needs are not being met 
	responsively. The child begins to expect that this will happen whenever a 
	need arises. Thus, the child fails to develop trust in adults and in himself 
	or herself. In short, the child becomes insecure rather than secure. </span>
	</p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many 
	undesirable outcomes can occur when a child forms an insecure attachment. 
	Youngsters who experience insecure attachments at home also form insecure 
	attachments with their preschool, kindergarten, and first-grade teachers. 
	</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These teachers often have difficulty building a relationship with these 
	young students because these children harbor negative views of adults. The 
	children are not trusting of their teachers and may act out in class. In 
	turn, it is difficult therefore for teachers to learn about these children’s 
	needs and to respond to them in a manner that helps them learn and adjust (Bowlby 
	1988).</span></p>
	<h3><span style="font-size: 11pt">Effects of Secure and Insecure Attachment
	</span></h3>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The type of 
	emotional attachment established during the first four or five years usually 
	lasts a lifetime.</span> The pattern of early attachment significantly influences 
	the quality of love relationship an individual will have as a teenager, 
	adult, and even as a parent with his or her own children. Let’s summarize 
	what research has concluded about the effects of secure and insecure 
	attachment. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children who 
	experienced a secure attachment at one year are better able to explore on 
	their own than are insecure infants (Waters, Whippman, &amp; Sroufe, 1979). 
	Secure toddlers are more independent than are their insecure peers, and as a 
	result, more curious and interested in exploring the world around them. 
	Secure infants and toddlers develop a sense of agency; that is, the sense 
	that “I am a person” and “I can do.” </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insecure infants and toddlers are far 
	less curious, and are far more inhibited and withdrawn (Kagan, 1981; Suess, 
	Grossman, &amp; Sroufe, 1992). As a result, secure children are better able than 
	are insecure children to master the environment using their senses. They are 
	also better able to perform related motor actions than are insecure infants 
	and toddlers (Matas, Arend, &amp; Sroufe, 1978).</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous 
	studies have concluded a positive relationship exists between the 
	development of secure attachment in the early years of life and later social 
	competence (e.g., Coleman, 2003; Lieberman, Doyle, &amp; Markiewicz, 1999). 
	Preschool children who are secure demonstrate better social skills and 
	school adjustment than do their insecure peers (Sroufe, Carlson, &amp; Schulman, 
	1993). Elementary school children who are secure are significantly more 
	accepted by their peers and have more friendships and are less lonely than 
	are less secure children (Kerns, Klepac, &amp; Cole, 1996). </span>
	</p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The attachment 
	security a child feels throughout his or her early years has been associated 
	with that youngster’s later ability to pay attention, focus, and learn</span> in 
	school. Children with secure attachment histories earn higher grades and are 
	more goal oriented and cooperative than are students with insecure 
	attachment histories (Crittenden, 1992; Jacobsen &amp; Hofmann, 1997).
	</span>
	</p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insecure 
	children are more likely to struggle academically than are secure children 
	(Wong, Wiest, &amp; Cusick, 2002). Secure children successfully bond with their 
	teacher, view their teacher favorably, have the confidence to succeed, and 
	use the teacher as a secure base from which to engage in academic tasks and 
	challenges (O’Conner &amp; McCartney, 2006). </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Children who have experienced 
	secure bonding later have high self-esteem and are confident in their 
	ability to excel academically</span>. These children prefer to be challenged in 
	class and are more motivated to learn for the sake of learning than are 
	their insecure counterparts. </span></p>
	<h3><span style="font-size: 11pt">Conclusion</span></h3>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to 
	attachment theory, the most essential task of the first years of life is the 
	creation of a child’s secure bond to the mother. Many studies have 
	demonstrated this by examining the interactions of mother and child and by 
	contrasting the long-term behavioral outcomes of securely and insecurely 
	attached children. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, research has shown that the type of
