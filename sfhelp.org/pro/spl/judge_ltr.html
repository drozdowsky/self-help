					Asking the legal system to resolve disputes like yours 
					demonstrate your current inability to problem-solve 
					effectively together. It also suggests that one or more 
					people involved in your dispute bear significant 
					psychological wounds, and don't know what that means that or 
					how to reduce their wounds. <u>If this is true, your 
					attorneys, the law, and my rulings <i>cannot</i> help you 
					reduce these basic problems</u>. There <i>are</i> practical 
					steps you can take to reduce them, once you understand and 
					accept these problems.</font></p>

					</u>is a lose-lose 
					decision. Attorneys are paid and motivated to <i>win - </i>
					which guarantees (a) an (expensive) antagonistic combative 
					process, and (b) someone will<i> lose. </i>The hurt, 
					resentment, anger, frustration, and expense you both will 
					incur from the legal process and what comes of it will 
					probably take years to heal, and significantly stress you 
					and your children (if any) long after I make a ruling on

					<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					I propose that there is an effective <i>non-legal</i> way to 
					resolve major disputes among your family members: </font>
					</p>
					<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<b>1)</b> agree to take a <i>long-term </i>view together 
					(e.g. the next 25 years), rather than focusing narrowly on 
					your current dispute. The real target here is to discover 
					what blocks you from effective problem-solving together, and 
					cooperatively removing the blocks to benefit all your family 
					members.</font></p>
					<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<b>2)</b> acknowledge that each of you adults is equally 
					responsible for causing and resolving your current dispute. 
					As long as either of you chooses an attitude of superiority 
					and blame (&quot;YOU are causing this problem, not ME!&quot;) all your 
					family members will suffer, and outsiders cannot help you. 
					The <i>way</i> you have been trying to resolve your dispute 
					is probably your real problem.</font></p>
					<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<b>3)</b> commit to (a) learning about psychological wounds, and 
					(b) honestly assess yourselves for them. You can find 
					information on this on the Web, at
					<a href="../../selfguide1.html" style="text-decoration: none">
					http://sfhelp.org/gwcguide1.htm</a> (a non-profit 
					educational site). That resource offers practical options 
					for reducing your wounds and protecting your descendents 
					from them. </font></p>
					<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 
					4)</b> learn about the common [wounds + ignorance] cycle 
					that has probably promoted the past and current stressors in 
					your family. See the non-profit slide presentation on this 
					at 
					<a href="../../fam/cycle_slides.html" style="text-decoration: none">
					http://sfhelp.org/fam/cycle_slides.htm</a>.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<b>5)</b> commit to learning and practicing 
					effective-communication basics and skills together. See 
					the perspective on these at
					<a href="../../cx/guide2.html" style="text-decoration: none">
					http://sfhelp.org/cx/guide2.htm</a>, and the slide 
					presentations and resources at
					<a href="../../cx/basics.html" style="text-decoration: none">

					<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					I'm glad to discuss this letter with you and your attorneys 
					within our mutual time constraints. I urge you to take these 
					steps for the long-term welfare of your family and your 
					descendents.</font></p>
