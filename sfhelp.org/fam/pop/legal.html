<font face="Arial"><u><b>About&nbsp; Family Legal Disputes</b></u></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8px">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;Most (all?) states have a 
&quot;family court&quot; to handle legal disputes among family members - specially those 
involving minor children. It's sadly common that divorcing adults rely on legal 
action to resolve ar-guments over divorce settlements, asset ownership, 
adoptions, par-enting agreements, child custody, orders of protection, and 
similar matters.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8px">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this occurs, 
it is a <u>sure</u> sign that one or more of the litigants (a) are wounded 
survivors of a low-nurturance childhood, who (b) are unaware of 
effective-communication basics and skills. </font> </p>
			<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8px">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common outcomes of 
using legal force are (a) raised resentments, dislike, enmity, and distrust 
among the disputants; (b) polarization of family members into opposing camps; 
(c) financial stresses; psycho-logical wounding of minor kids; and (d) 
slow-healing emotional scars among family members. </font> </p>
			<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8px">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These results are 
often amplified because most attorneys judges, and professional mediators are 
unaware of family dynamics and re-alities - specially in divorcing and step 
families.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8px">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <b><u>far</u></b> 
more productive alternative to court actions is family members studying and 
applying this course - specially Lessons 1 (heal psycho-logical wounds) and 2 
(learn effective communication skills)!</font></p>
