	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Cynthia Scott</b> is your average health-conscious 56-year-old. She watches 
	what she eats, drinks lots of water and takes a multivitamin every morning. 
	She goes for frequent walks and visits her doctor regularly for checkups, 
	including cholesterol and diabetes screenings.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott also has schizoaffective bipolar disorder, 
	a <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">mental illness</span> she keeps in 
	check with a low dose of Zyprexa. If you were to ask Scott, she would say 
	she is a healthy person overall. So she was shocked when the <u>National 
	Association of State Mental Health Program Directors</u> (NASMHPD) 
	published a study two years ago (2006) called
	<a href="http://www.dsamh.utah.gov/docs/mortality-morbidity_nasmhpd.pdf">
	<u>Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness</u></a>. 
	The report analyzed data from 16 states and found that, on average,
	<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">people with severe mental illness 
	die 25 years earlier than the general population</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">.</span> &quot;Hearing that made 
	me so sad,&quot; says Scott. (See the Year in Health, from A to Z.)<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings were a bombshell for the rest of the 
	mental-health community. &quot;The study jarred the field,&quot; says Dr. Bob Glover, 
	the executive director of NASMHPD. After the 2006 report came out, many 
	mental-health agencies in the U.S. made it an immediate priority to figure 
	out why their patients die sooner and how to improve their longevity. Says 
	Glover: <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">&quot;Mental health has been late 
	to the dance in terms of looking at the connections between mental health 
	and physical health.</span> It may be moot what you're doing for mental-health 
	needs if people are dying so early from physical causes.&quot;<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the causes of physical illness and death 
	among psychiatric patients are much the same as those in other groups - 
	cigarette smoking, obesity, diabetes - and are treatable. The problem is 
	that people with serious mental illness tend to be low on the socioeconomic 
	totem pole and often don't get the best available health care. </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently, their own doctors pay little heed to their patients' physical 
	health. &quot;Medical doctors think, 'Well, they're crazy,' so they don't take 
	their concerns seriously,&quot; says Wendy Brennan, executive director of the 
	National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 
	in New York City. <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">&quot;Their very real 
	physical symptoms are often dismissed.&quot;</span></font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most common contributors 
	to early death among mentally ill patients, for instance, is smoking. While 
	about 22% of the general population smokes,<span style="background-color: #FFFF99">
	</span><span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">more than 75% of people with 
	severe mental illness are tobacco-dependent<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: #FCFFB7">.
	</span></span> </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Glover, a study conducted by NASMHPD after the publication of 
	its mortality study found that <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">44% 
	of all cigarettes in the United States are consumed by people with 
	psychiatric histories</span>. &quot;I used to run state hospitals, and we'd use 
	cigarettes as reinforcement - 'You did good; you get a cigarette,'&quot; he 
	says. &quot;When people didn't do well, we took away their tobacco privileges. We 
	were part of the problem.&quot; The agency is now working to make state mental 
	hospitals smoke-free by 2011.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obesity is another big risk factor.<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> 
	</span><span style="background-color: #FCFFB7"> 
	People with depression or bipolar disorder are about twice as likely to be 
	obese as the general population</span>; in people with schizophrenia, that 
	likelihood is three times greater. This is in part because so many 
	psychotropic medications cause weight gain. At many state hospitals, says 
	Glover, &quot;you'd see a woman be admitted at 120 lb. Three to six months later, 
	she'd weigh 200.&quot;<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Obesity-related illnesses, like 
	diabetes, are so prevalent among the mentally ill that health officials call 
	them an epidemic within an epidemic</span>. For example, about 13% of schizophrenic 
	adults in their 50s have received a diabetes diagnosis, compared with 8% of 
	the general population of the same age. </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October, the NASMHPD released another report, with recommendations for 
	treating the particular problem of obesity, including giving those with 
	severe mental illness better access to dietary consultations and promoting 
	the prescription of low-weight-gain antipsychotics. The agency is currently 
	working on creating a tool kit for federal health-care providers to better 
	inform them on the issue.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At NAMI–New York City, after reading the 
	2006 mortality report, health workers held focus groups to assess their 
	patients' health concerns. There were many - foremost among them, the simple 
	desire to feel deserving of good health. &quot;The most shocking thing was that 
	people really wanted to be healthy but there was a disconnect,&quot; says program 
	associate Katie Linn, who ran the focus groups. &quot;A lot of it came down to

	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the participants' responses, 
	NAMI created a program called <u>Six Weeks to Wellness</u>, a weekly class 
	that teaches everything from proper nutrition to controlling anxiety through 
	yoga and meditation. &quot;It's been wildly popular,&quot; says Linn. &quot;It helps to 
	say, 'Your health is important to us.' They've never heard that before.&quot;<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">For the 
	NASMHPD, the next logical step is to educate the doctors who care for the 
	mentally ill</span>. This month, the agency will release guidelines for 
	standardizing the medical tests, assessments and care given to mental-health 
	patients in the public system. The recommendations include taking regular 
	measurements of patients' height and weight, checking their glucose levels 
	and carefully evaluating their medication history. Psychiatrists, likewise, 
	are not exempt. </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to <u>Mental Heath 
	America</u>, based in Virginia, a recent survey of people with schizophrenia 
	revealed that they rarely discussed physical health with their 
	psychiatrists. So the organization is working on an initiative with the 
	<u>American Psychological Association</u> to better educate mental-health 
	specialists about the physical concerns facing patients with serious mental 
	illness.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Cynthia Scott, over the past two 
	years she has taken her health consciousness to a whole new level, regularly 
	attending NAMI's yoga workshops in New York City. &quot;I'm big on taking care of 
	myself,&quot; she says.</font></p>
