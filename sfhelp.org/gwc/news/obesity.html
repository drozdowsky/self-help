								<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;By KEVIN 
								FREKING, Associated Press Writer<br>
								Yahoo News, Aug 27, 2007</font><p align="left">
								<font face="Arial" size="2">Loosen the belt 
								buckle another notch:
								<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Obesity 
								rates continued to climb in 31 states last year, 
								and no state showed a decline</span><span style="background-color: #F3F3F3">.</span><br>
								<br>
								Mississippi became the first state to crack the 
								30 percent barrier for adults considered to be 
								obese. West Virginia and Alabama were just 
								behind, according to the Trust for America's 
								Health, a research group that focuses on disease 
								prevention.<br>
								<br>
								Colorado continued its reign as the leanest 
								state in the nation with an obesity rate 
								projected at 17.6 percent.<br>
								<br>
								This year's report, for the first time, looked 
								at rates of overweight children ages 10 to 17. 
								The District of Columbia had the highest 
								percentage — 22.8 percent. Utah had the lowest — 
								8.5 percent.<br>
								<br>
								<span style="background-color: #FEFFE1">Health 
								officials say the latest state rankings provide 
								evidence that the nation has a public health 
								crisis on its hands.<br>
								<br>
								Unfortunately, we're treating it like a mere 
								inconvenience instead of the emergency that it 
								is,&quot;</span> said Dr. James Marks, senior vice 
								president at the <u>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</u>, 
								a philanthropy devoted to improving health care.<br>
								<br>
								Officials at the Trust for America's Health want 
								the government to play a larger role in 
								preventing obesity.
								<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">People 
								who are overweight are at an increased risk for 
								diabetes, heart problems and other chronic 
								diseases</span><span style="background-color: #F3F3F3"> 
								that contribute to greater health care costs.</span><br>
								<br>
								&quot;It's one of those issues where everyone 
								believes this is an epidemic, but
								<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">it's not 
								getting the level of political and policymaker 
								attention that it ought to</span>,&quot; said Jeffrey 
								Levi, the organization's executive director. &quot;As 
								every candidate for president talks about health 
								care reform and controlling health care cost 
								costs, if we don't home in on this issue, none 
								of their proposals are going to be affordable.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								At the same time, many believe weight is a 
								personal choice and responsibility. Levi doesn't 
								dispute that notion, but he said society can 
								help people make good choices.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;If we want kids to eat healthier food, we have 
								to invest the money for school nutrition 
								programs so that school lunches are healthier,&quot; 
								he said. &quot;If we want people to be more 
								physically active, then there have to be safe 
								places to be active. That's not just a class 
								issue. We've designed suburban communities where 
								there are no sidewalks for anybody to go out and 
								take a walk.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								To measure obesity rates, <u>Trust for America's 
								Health</u> compares data from 2003-2005 with 
								2004-2006. It combines information from three 
								years to improve the accuracy of projections. 
								The data come from a survey of height and weight 
								taken over the telephone. Because the 
								information comes from a personal estimate, some 
								believe it is conservative.<br>
								<br>
								Indeed, the
								<span style="background-color: #F3F3F3"><u>Centers 
								for Disease Control and Prevention</u> released a 
								study last year noting a national obesity rate 
								of about 32 percent</span> — a higher rate than 
								was cited for any of the states in the Trust for 
								America's Health report. The CDC's estimate came 
								from weighing people rather than relying on 
								telephone interviews, officials explained.<br>
								<br>
								Generally, anyone with a body mass index greater 
								than 30 is considered obese. The index is a 
								ratio that takes into account height and weight. 
								The overweight range is 25 to 29.9. Normal is 
								18.5 to 24.9. People with a large amount of lean 
								muscle mass, such as athletes, can show a large 
								body mass index without having an unhealthy 
								level of fat.<br>
								<br>
								<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">A lack 
								of exercise is a huge factor in obesity rates</span>. 
								The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
								found last year that more than 22 percent of 
								Americans did not engage in any physical 
								activity in the past month. The percentage is 
								greater than 30 percent in four states: 
								Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky and Tennessee.<br>
								<br>
								Meanwhile, Minnesotans led the way when it came 
								to exercise. An estimated 15.4 percent of the 
								state's residents did not engage an any physical 
								exercise — the best rate in the nation. Still, 
								the state ranked 28th overall when it came to 
								the percentage of obese adults.<br>
								<br>
								<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Another 
								factor in obesity rates is poverty</span>. The 
								five poorest states were all in the top 10 when 
								it came to obesity rates. An exception to that 
								rule was the District of Columbia and New 
								Mexico. Both had high poverty rates, but also 
								one of the lower obesity rates among adults.<br>
								<br>
								Poverty can lead to less safe neighborhoods, 
								which deter children from playing. It can lead 
								to fewer grocery stores offering fruits and 
								vegetables, and it can lead to greater reliance 
								on fast food, officials said.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;It seems<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7"> the cheapest foods are the worst ones 
								for you</span>,&quot; Marks said. <br>
								<br>
								Officials said the report is not designed to 
								stigmatize states with high obesity rates but to 
								stir them into action. <br>
								<br>
								&quot;These are the states where the urgency is the 
								greatest. They need not to wait for others to 
								lead. They need to become the leaders,&quot; Marks 
								said. &quot;It's the only way that they can restore 
								the health of their children and their families. 
								It's the only way that they can improve their 
								economic competitiveness.&quot;&nbsp; <br>

								<font face="Arial"><b>New method 
								finds networks of genes behind obesity</b>
								</font>
								<p align="center">
								<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Maggie Fox,</b> 
								Reuters Health and Science Editor<br>
								Yahoo News, 3/16/08 </font>
								<p align="left">
								<font face="Arial" size="2">Overeating 
								disrupts entire networks of genes in the body, 
								causing not only obesity, but diabetes and heart 
								disease, in ways that may be possible to 
								predict, researchers reported on Sunday.<br>
								<br>
								The researchers developed a new method of 
								analyzing DNA and used it to discover that 
								obesity is not only complex -- something already 
								known -- but complex in ways that had not been 
								previously understood.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;Obesity is not a disease that is the result of 
								a single change to a single gene. It changes 
								entire networks,&quot; said Eric Schadt, executive 
								director of Genetics at <u>Merck Research 
								Laboratories</u>. His team identified networks of 
								hundreds of genes that appear to be thrown out 
								of kilter when mice are fed a high-fat diet.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;This network is completely rocked by exposure 
								to a high-fat, Western-type diet,&quot; Schadt said.<br>
								<br>
								They then turned to a database of Icelandic 
								people being studied by Decode Genetics Inc and 
								found people have the same networks.<br>
								<br>
								The joint teams did a detailed study of 1,000 
								blood samples and almost 700 samples of fat 
								tissues from some of the Icelandic volunteers. 
								This showed that people who have a higher body 
								mass index, a measurement of obesity, have 
								characteristic patterns of gene activation in 
								their fatty tissues not seen in DNA taken from 
								blood.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;What it says it that the common forms of these 
								diseases are very complex,&quot; said Schadt.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;Simple genetic tests cannot detect these 
								networks,&quot; said Schadt, who also works at Merck 
								subsidiary <u>Rosetta Inpharmatics</u> in Seattle. 
								Schadt said his team hoped to study these 
								networks and identify the genes most key to 
								causing disease. New drugs can be designed to 
								target their activity, he said.<br>
								<br>
								Companies can also profit from making tests to 
								detect a person's particular pattern and his or 
								her risk of various diseases related to 
								overeating.<br>
								<br>
								IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>
								<br>
								<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">&quot;</span><span style="background-color: #FEFFE1"><u>Good 
								diet and exercise is still probably the best 
								treatment</u> or way to prevent the onset of 
								obesity,</span>&quot; Schadt said.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;If you are not going to alter your lifestyle, 
								we can identify what network is going to be most 
								significantly altered. Then we can bring that 
								network more into a state to where it looks like 
								when you are on a normal diet.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Schadt's team, writing in two studies published 
								in the journal <u>Nature</u>, said the diseases 
								of obesity appear to originate in the immune 
								system.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;The network is enriched for genes that are 
								involved in macrophages,&quot; Schadt said.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;In a normal state these things are keeping you 
								free of infection and fighting off things that 
								want to harm your body. This network is also 
								significantly changed when you are on a high-fat 
								diet,&quot; he added. <br>
								<br>
								Some people have networks that predispose them 
								to diabetes when they become obese, others to 
								high cholesterol and clogged arteries. <br>
								<br>
								Some network patterns appeared to predispose 
								some people to so-called metabolic syndrome, in 
								which patients develop a cluster of symptoms 
								including high blood sugar, high blood pressure 
								and clogged arteries. <br>
								<br>
								And a lucky few can become obese with no 
								apparent direct health consequences, at least as 
								concerns heart disease and diabetes. <br>
