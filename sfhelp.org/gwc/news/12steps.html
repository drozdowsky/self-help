	a big month for winter sports and post-Christmas sales. It's also - as 
	people who treat substance abuse know - a big month for drinkers who want 
	to quit. The holidays are over and bank accounts are thin, but addicts can't 
	stop partying. Many choose January to ask, at long last, for help. But what 
	sort of help is the most useful? (See TIME &quot;The Year in Medicine 2008: From 
	A to Z.&quot;)<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For decades, the primary approach to (addiction) 
	rehabilitation in the U.S. has been 12-step programs like
	<a href="http://www.aa.org/"><u>Alcoholics Anonymous</u></a> (AA). 
	Twelve-step doctrine defines addiction in a contradictory way: as a medical problem, 
	like a lifelong illness, with a spiritual solution (surrendering to a higher 
	power). The model has become so culturally <!--webbot bot="JBOT" WIP="yes" startspan Preview="hegemonic " S-Class="texttips" tag="p" s-message="predominant" s-color="4194304" clientside -->

	to imagine any other way to stop getting drunk or doing drugs - or gambling, 
	overeating or watching porn, for that matter. </font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	When we see Anne Hathaway's character in the film Rachel Getting Married at 
	a 12-step meeting or when we watch D-list celebrities work the steps on 
	VH1's new reality show Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House, it's easy to 
	think 12-step is not only the best way to get well, but the only way. 
	There's a growing body of evidence, however, that suggests that's not so. 
	(Read a 1940 TIME article about Alcoholics Anonymous.)<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In last month's (12/08)
	Journal of 
	Substance Abuse Treatment, University of New Mexico addiction specialist 
	William Miller and his colleagues presented findings from two controlled 
	trials in which patients underwent drug treatment. Some of the patients 
	received spiritual guidance as part of the treatment - learning such 
	practices as prayer, meditation and service to others, all of which are 
	central to 12-step programs. </font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others 
	received secular psychotherapy. Because of the enduring popularity of AA and 
	similar pro-grams that involve a spiritual component, Miller and his team 
	expected the patients in the spiritual group to do better than those in the 
	secular group. They were wrong - at least in the short term.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While both groups eventually benefited relatively equally 
	from their treatment - abusing substances on fewer days - it took longer to 
	see improvement among those in the spiritual group. What's more, those who 
	received spiritual guidance reported being significantly more anxious and 
	depressed after four months than those who got secular help. </font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those 
	problems abated at about the eight-month point, but because substance

	idea to put them through demanding spiritual calisthenics in the early 
	months of their recovery. (Read a 2007 TIME cover story, &quot;How We Get Addicted.&quot;)<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study amplifies a fascinating paper Miller co-authored 
	in 1997, which found that patients who reported knowing that someone was 
	praying for them used significantly more substances after leaving treatment 
	than those who didn't know someone was praying for them. </font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Taken 
	together, Miller's studies suggest that spirituality can be demanding - even 
	when others are being spiritual on your behalf</span> - and that many addicts may 
	simply not be up to the pressure. For those people, non-faith-based 
	treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based acceptance 
	and commitment therapy might be better.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These challenges to addiction orthodoxy come along as 
	scientists and sufferers alike continue to look for a faster fix for 
	substance abuse. New York cardiologist Dr. Olivier Ameisen - who now lives 
	in France but remains a visiting professor at the State University of New 
	York - has authored a new book describing his recovery from alcoholism, 
	which was achieved with the aid of a common drug called <b>baclofen</b>, a 
	muscle-relaxant designed to prevent the spasms behind a range of conditions 
	from hiccups to multiple sclerosis symptoms. </font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The claim 
	is drawing a lot of attention, but it is too soon to say how effective the 
	drug will be for other alcoholics or how widely it will be embraced by the 
	addiction community. (Read a 1974 TIME cover story, &quot;Alcoholism: New 
	Victims, New Treatment.&quot;) <br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month, investigators in the U.S. reported good test 
	results for a monthly dose of the common antidrinking drug <b>naltrexone</b> 
	- a medication that currently must be taken every day to be effective. But 
	naltrexone is controversial because for some, it doesn't do anything to 
	reduce the craving for alcohol until those addicts actually take a drink, 
	whereupon it helps them resist taking more - a twisted bit of physiological 
	irony if ever there was one. Twelve-step believers say the only proper 
	response to alcoholism is total abstinence, and that a drug that allows you 
	to drink a little puts you on a slippery slope to drinking a lot.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1 in 5 people with alcohol dependence stop drinking 
	without any treatment, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
	Mental Disorders (DSM), the field guide mental-health professionals use to 
	diagnose illnesses. That means we have to figure out a way to help the 80% 
	who won't get better through willpower. The latest evidence suggests that 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">those who think that spirituality or a pill alone can save them are wrong. The answer almost certainly lies 
	deeper inside ourselves</span>.<br>

	</b>This article doesn't speculate on the cause of addiction, tho it refers 
	to other TIME articles that may do so. It also doesn't define what &quot;recovery 
	from addiction&quot; means. It basically questions whether the traditional way 
	to attain sobriety thru adopting the spiritually-based 12-step philosophy is 
	the only way. It notes the reality that for most addicts, &quot;willpower is not 
	enough&quot; to break their toxic compulsion.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on research by William Miller, the article suggests that the 12-steps' reliance on belief in a Higher Power may put too 
	much &quot;pressure&quot; on some addicts compared to &quot;secular&quot; (non-spiritual) 
	therapy or some drug treatments. The article ignores a major benefit of
