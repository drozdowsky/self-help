    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">(Aug. 30, 2007) - Americans who 
	log long hours on the job find the time for leisure and other activities by 
	cutting down on sleep, a study reports today.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;We only have 24 hours in a 
	day,&quot; says Mathias Basner, a researcher at the <u>University of Pennsylvania School of 
	Medicine.</u><br>
	<br>
	His study of 47,731 Americans found that people who worked more simply got 
	up earlier or went to bed later -- a practice that puts them at risk of 
	sleep deprivation. <span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Time spent at 
	work is the single biggest determinant of how much sleep Americans got on a 
	typical day</span>, according to the study in the Sept. 1 issue of the 
	journal <u>Sleep</u>. But travel time, 
	including time sitting in traffic on the way to work, comes in second place, 
	Basner says.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;You could argue there's a 
	hidden cost to living in suburbia,&quot; says Gregory Belenky, director of the
	<u>Sleep and 
	Performance Research Center</u> at Washington State University in Spokane. 
	People who live in sprawling urban areas often make a long workday even 
	longer when they try to run errands on clogged roads, he says.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
	<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Basner says sleep deprivation has 
	been linked to a number of serious health problems, including obesity.</span></font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">People who are chronically 
	sleep-deprived also can experience attention lapses, memory loss and other 
	difficulties that can impair performance on the job, says James Walsh, 
	executive director of the sleep medicine and research center at St. Luke's 
	Hospital in St. Louis.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">And fatigue can add an element 
	of danger to an already stressful commute. &quot;If you're only sleeping five 
	hours a night, you're at risk of falling asleep at the wheel,&quot; Walsh says.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The
	<u>National Sleep Foundation</u> 
	estimates that sleep-deprived drivers cause more than 100,000 automobile 
	crashes a year and more than 1,500 deaths.</span></font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Basner's team analyzed the 
	results of a federal survey conducted in 2003 through 2005. People were 
	asked to account for their time over a 24-hour period. The survey suggests 
	that people who cut back on sleep on weekdays often try to sleep in on 
	Saturday and Sunday. But <span style="background-color: #F5F5F5">people who 
	cut back on sleep night after night might never catch up, Walsh says.</span></font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
	<span style="background-color: #F5F5F5">Surveys suggest Americans get about 
	6½ hours of sleep a night -- about an hour less than the average in the 
	1950s</span>, he says. Today, many adults extend their workdays by using 
	cellphones to check e-mail messages.<br>
	<br>
	A second study in <u>Sleep</u> suggests that teens who use cellphones after lights 
	out can have daytime sleepiness. The teens in this study lived in Europe, 
	but teens in the USA also use cellphones to text-message and chat with 
	friends at all hours, says Amy Wolfson of the National Sleep Foundation.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;We're living in a 24/7 culture, 
	and teens are mimicking adults,&quot; she says.<br>
	<br>
	Says Walsh: &quot;People feel that sleep is negotiable.&quot; Yet studies suggest that 
	most adults need from seven to eight hours of sleep a night, and teens need 
	nine hours or more in order to do their best during the day, he says.<br>

<p align="center"><b>Too Little Childhood Sleep Tied to Later Problems</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>By Will Dunham,</b> Reuters News&nbsp;-&nbsp;4-07-2008</p>
<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #FEFDD6">Getting too little sleep 
doubles a young child's risk of being overweight and raises the chances of later 
anxiety and depression</span>, researchers said on Monday.<br>
<br>
Several studies published in the journal <u>Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine</u> add heft to the notion that 
getting enough sleep has wide-ranging health benefits.<br>
<br>
Previous studies have shown that older children and adults who get too little 
sleep are more likely to weigh too much. Researchers led by Dr. Elsie Taveras of 
Harvard Medical School demonstrated that this is also the case in very young 
kids.<br>
<br>
In a study involving 915 children in Massachusetts, they found that those who 
slept less than 12 hours a day in the first two years of life were twice as 
likely to be overweight at age 3 than children who slept longer.<br>
<br>
Very young children need more sleep and those in this study slept an average of 
12.3 hours per day.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are consequences to children not sleeping well, even at this age,&quot; 
Taveras said in a telephone interview. <span style="background-color: #F5F5F5">
&quot;It's going to be important to help parents learn how to improve the quality of 
their children's sleep.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Television tended to make matters worse</span>, 
with children who watched two or more hours daily by age 2 more likely to be 
overweight at age 3, the researchers said. Taveras said getting enough sleep is 
becoming harder with televisions, computers and video games in kids' bedrooms.<br>
<br>
The researchers said previous studies in adults and older children have shown 
that restricting sleep changes certain hormone levels, possibly stimulating 
hunger and weight gain.<br>
<br>
EMOTIONAL FALLOUT<br>
<br>
Another team of researchers led by Alice Gregory of the
<u>University of London</u> examined the long-term 
emotional fallout from too little sleep in childhood. They gathered sleep data 
on 2,076 Dutch children ages 4 to 16, and then questioned them as adults years 
later about various emotional and behavioral symptoms.<br>
<br>
The children who slept less than others 
reported more anxiety, depression and aggressive behavior as adults, the 
researchers said.<br>
<br>
Researchers led by Valerie Sung of <u>Royal 
Children's Hospital</u> in Parkville, Australia found that
<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">children with <!--webbot bot="FLOATWIN" WIP="yes" startspan Preview="<a class=&quot;Popup&quot; href=#>attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder </a>" s-wudll="popup.dll" i-bordersize="0" s-windowname="adhd" i-type="1" b-center="1" tag="p" i-rotate="0" s-class="floatwin" u-windowurl="../../parent/pop/ADHD.htm" clientside i-top="0" i-width="480" b-resizable="1" i-height="460" i-left="0" s-hyperlink="attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder " -->

had sleep problems</span>. Among 239 Australian children ages 5 to 18 years with 
ADHD in the study, 73 percent had sleep problems. Their most common problems 
were difficulty falling asleep, resisting going to bed and tiredness upon 
waking, Sung said.<br>
<br>
Compared to other children with ADHD but no sleep problems, these children were 
more likely to have poorer quality of life and daily functioning, as well as 
poorer school attendance.<br>
<br>
Sung offered advice to families of children with ADHD. &quot;If you are worried about 
your child's sleep, ask your doctor for help, and if help is not forthcoming, 
keep asking and seek help from a specialist sleep clinic at your closest 
children's hospital,&quot; Sung said by e-mail.<br>
