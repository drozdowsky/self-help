		In the city of Greensboro, N.C., there&#39;s a program designed for teenage 
		mothers. To prevent these teens from having another child, the city 
		offers each of them $1 a day for every day they are not pregnant. It 
		turns out that the psychological power of that small daily payment is 
		huge. A single dollar a day is enough to push the rate of teen pregnancy 
		down, saving all the incredible costs — human and financial — that go 
		with teen parenting.<br>
		<br>
		Cass Sunstein, President Obama&#39;s pick to head the Office of Information 
		and Regulatory Affairs, is a vocal supporter of the program, because 
		it&#39;s an economic policy that shapes itself around human psychology. 
		Sunstein is just one of a number of high-level appointees now working in 
		the Obama administration who favors this kind of approach. <br>
		<br>
		All are devotees of behavioral economics — a school of economic thought 
		greatly influenced by psychological research — which argues that the 
		human animal is hard-wired to make errors when it comes to 
		decision-making, and therefore people need a little &quot;nudge&quot; to make 
		decisions that are in their own best interests. <br>
		<br>
		And that is exactly what Obama administration officials plan to do: By 
		taking account of human psychology, they hope to save you from yourself.
		<br>
		<br>
		This is the story of how obscure psychological research into human 
		decision-making first revolutionized economics and now appears poised to 
		remake the relationship between the government and its citizens.<br>
		<br>
		<b>How Behavioral Economics Came To Be</b><br>
		<br>
		The ideas that underlie the Obama administration&#39;s approach to social 
		policies got their start in 1955 with Daniel Kahneman. Then a young 
		psychologist in the Israeli army, Kahneman&#39;s primary job was to try to 
		figure out which of his fellow soldiers might make good officers. To do 
		this, Kahneman ran the men through an unusual exercise: He organized 
		them into groups of eight, took away all their insignia so know one knew 
		who had a higher rank, and told them to lift an enormous telephone pole 
		over a 6-foot wall. <br>
		<br>
		Kahneman felt the exercise was incredibly revealing. &quot;We could see who 
		was a leader, who was taking charge,&quot; Kahneman says. &quot;We could see who 
		was a quitter, who gave up. And we thought that what we saw before us is 
		how they would behave in combat.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Certain of their wisdom, Kahneman and his fellow psychologists would 
		make recommendations after the exercise. The chosen men would go to 
		officer school, and Kahneman would move on to the next batch of 
		soldiers. There was only one problem: Kahneman and his colleagues were 
		terrible at it. <br>
		<br>
		Every month or so, Kahneman would get feedback from the school about his 
		picks, and &quot;there was absolutely no relationship between what we saw and 
		what people saw who examined them for six months in officer training 
		school,&quot; he says. <br>
		<br>
		But here&#39;s the remarkable thing: Despite the negative feedback, 
		Kahneman&#39;s faith in his own ability was unshaken. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;The next day after getting those statistics, we put them there in front 
		of the wall, gave them a telephone pole, and we were just as convinced 
		as ever that we knew what kind of officer they were going to be.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<b>People Make Irrational Choices </b><br>
		<br>
		Kahneman was surprised by the pure visceral power of his own certainty. 
		He eventually coined a phrase for it: &quot;illusion of validity.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		It&#39;s a problem that afflicts us all, says Kahneman, who won the 2002 
		Nobel Prize in economics for his work on this subject. From stockbrokers 
		to baseball scouts, people have a huge amount of confidence in their own 
		judgment, even in the face of evidence that their judgment is wrong. <br>
		<br>
		But that mistake is just one of many cognitive errors identified by 
		Kahneman and his frequent collaborator, psychologist Amos Tversky. For 
		more than a decade, the two worked together cataloging the ways the 
		human mind systematically misjudges the world around it. <br>
		<br>
		For instance, Kahneman and Tversky identified &quot;anchoring bias.&quot; It turns 
		out that whenever you are exposed to a number, you are influenced by 
		that number whether you intend to be influenced or not. <br>
		<br>
		This is why, for example, the minimum payments suggested on your credit 
		card bill tend to be low. That number frames your expectation, so you 
		pay less of the bill than you might otherwise, your interest continues 
		to grow, and your credit card company makes more money than if you had 
		not had your expectations influenced by the low number.<br>
		<br>
		Through their research, Kahneman and Tversky identified dozens of these 
		biases and errors in judgment, which together painted a certain picture 
		of the human animal. Human beings, it turns out, don&#39;t always make good 
		decisions, and frequently the choices they do make aren&#39;t in their best 
		interest. <br>
		<br>
		In the realm of academic psychology, this isn&#39;t much of a revelation — 
		psychologists see people as flawed in all kinds of ways. So, if the 
		ideas of Kahneman and Tversky had simply stayed in the realm of academic 
		psychology, there wouldn&#39;t be much of a story to tell. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Economics Mixes With Psychology </b><br>
		<br>
		The economist Richard Thaler, frequently mentioned as a contender for a 
		Nobel, was the one who integrated Kahneman and Tversky&#39;s ideas about 
		human irrationality into economics. Now a well-respected professor at 
		the University of Chicago, Thaler was first introduced to the work of 
		Kahneman and Tversky when he was still a young professor. <br>
		<br>
		Thaler was so smitten with their ideas that he contrived to spend a year 
		at Stanford, where the two psychologists would also be teaching for the 
		year. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;I remember Dick showing up to my office … and our friendship really 
		started immediately — and it has gone on to this day,&quot; Kahneman says.
		<br>
		<br>
		The three of them spent a year walking the hills of Stanford. Kahneman 
		and Tversky taught Thaler about psychology; Thaler, in turn, taught 
		Kahneman and Tversky about economics. <br>
		<br>
		In the early &#39;80s, they began to publish their ideas — an integration of 
		psychological research and economics with this new flawed decision-maker 
		at the center. But initially, mainstream economists largely rejected the 
		work. <br>
		<br>
		The main point of contention, says Thaler, was the suggestion that 
		humans are less than perfectly rational when it comes to 
		decision-making. For the majority of the 20th century, and for the most 
		part even today, the human beings imagined by economists and placed at 
		the center of their economic models have had a Spock-like rationality.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Economists literally assume that the agents in the economy are as smart 
		as the smartest economist,&quot; Thaler says. &quot;And not just smart: We&#39;re not 
		overweight; we never overdrink; and we save just enough for retirement. 
		But, of course, the people we know aren&#39;t like that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		So why would economists assume that human beings are so hyper-rational?
		<br>
		<br>
		Because using a rational human in their mathematical models works. For 
		decades, economists have been using idealized humans to predict 
		everything from international trade to market prices, and they&#39;ve done 
		pretty well. They&#39;ve been able to figure out all kinds of things. Also, 
		it&#39;s hard to include more realistic human behavior in an economic model.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The Challenges Of Modeling An Irrational Human</b><br>
		<br>
		&quot;Behavioral economics has identified a dizzying array of human foibles. 
		We clearly can&#39;t incorporate all of them, and because of that, people 
		feel that incorporating one error into your model may be just as 
		unrealistic as incorporating none,&quot; says Ed Glaeser, a professor of 
		economics at Harvard University.<br>
		<br>
		But there&#39;s probably another reason for economists&#39; resistance. An 
		imperfectly rational human being challenges a really important idea: the 
		notion that markets work well because individuals can be counted on to 
		make the best choice for themselves. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;Merely accepting the fact that people do not necessarily make the best 
		decisions for themselves is politically very explosive. The moment that 
		you admit that, you have to start protecting people,&quot; Kahneman says.<br>
		<br>
		In other words, if the human brain is hard-wired to make serious errors, 
		that implies all kinds of things about the need for regulation and 
		protection. <br>
		<br>
		Thaler and Sunstein wrote a book on exactly this issue called Nudge: 
		Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness. <br>
		<br>
		The book proposed that if you want people to save for retirement, for 
		example, it&#39;s important to take account of the fact that people are 
		easily overwhelmed by information and so are likely to simply opt for 
		the status quo. The lesson for policymakers is clear, says Thaler. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;If you want people to enroll in the pension plan, then automatically 
		enroll them — and let them opt out if they want to.&quot; You must push them 
		in the right direction.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The Psychological Research Jumps To Policy</b><br>
		<br>
		But critics like Glaeser are worried. Glaeser, as well as many 
		Republican critics, believes that our current economic predicament is 
		the product of government intervening in the markets in a way that 
		distorted incentives. Glaeser says that, if anything, the current crisis 
		is proof that the Obama administration has drawn just the wrong 
		conclusions from Kahneman and Thaler&#39;s work. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;Just understanding that human beings don&#39;t make perfect decisions does 
		not make the case for government by any stretch of the imagination,&quot; 
		Glaeser says. &quot;After all, governments are made up of people, too. They 
		are subject to the same foibles and weakness as the rest of us.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		But Thaler argues that government policymakers don&#39;t need to be 
		hyper-rational to help people make better choices. <br>
		<br>
		He offers this example: Any American who goes to London realizes that 
		they are endangering their lives every time they try to cross the 
		street, because the traffic comes from the wrong direction. Our instinct 
		is to look left, but if you look left, you&#39;ll get run over by a 
		double-decker bus. <br>
		<br>
		To help us, Thaler says, someone in the British government decided to 
		write on the sidewalks of busy intersections filled with American 
		tourists the words &quot;look right.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		&quot;British bureaucrats are no smarter than American bureaucrats,&quot; says 
		Thaler, &quot;but they know that tourists tend to look the wrong way and 
		could use a helpful nudge to avoid getting hit by a truck.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		The Obama administration believes it needs to shape policy in a way that 
		will keep us all from getting hit by trucks — health care trucks, 
		financial trucks, trucks that come from every direction and affect every 
		aspect of our lives.</font></p>

	Instead of exploring why average people don&#39;t act in their best long-term 
	interest (like most kids), these economic psychologists propose &quot;nudging&quot; 
	(persuading) people to make healthier decisions for themselves - at least 
	economically. This may be useful, but is a bandage, not a cure. Their 
	approach implies that nothing can be done to make average people &quot;more
