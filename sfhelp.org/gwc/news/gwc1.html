	&#8211; A man facing eviction over his hostile temper became enraged by how his 
	wife cooked his eggs and killed her, his stepdaughter and three neighbors 
	with a shotgun before shooting himself on Saturday.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">Trooper Jody 
	Sims of the Kentucky State Police said 47-year-old Stanley Neace killed the 
	five people in two mobile homes in rural eastern Kentucky around 11:30 a.m., 
	then went to his home and turned the gun on himself.<br>
	<br>
	Neighbors in the roadside mobile home park said Neace stormed across the 
	lawns of about seven homes in his pajamas and fired dozens of shots from a 
	12-gauge pump shotgun.<br>
	<br>
	Sims said that when state police arrived about an hour after the gunfire 
	began, they heard a single gunshot and found Neace's body on the porch in 
	the unincorporated community of Mount Carmel in Breathitt County. The county 
	is home to about 16,000 people.<br>
	<br>
	Sherri Anne Robinson, a relative of two of the victims, said witnesses to 
	the shootings told her that Neace became enraged when his wife did not cook 
	his breakfast to his liking.<br>
	<br>
	Robinson said that when his wife fled to a neighbor's trailer, Neace 
	followed and shot her and the others. Robinson says he allowed a young girl 
	to flee.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;He just got mad at his wife for not making his breakfast right and he shot 
	her,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;She tried to run to tell my family and he shot them 
	too because they found out about it.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The victims were identified as the gunman's wife, Sandra Neace, 54; her 
	daughter Sandra R. Strong, 28; and neighbors Dennis Turner, 31; Teresa 
	Fugate, 30; and Tammy Kilborn, 40.<br>
	<br>
	The names of the victims were provided by Kentucky State Police, while 
	Robinson described their relationships. Fugate is Robinson's sister, Turner 
	is her cousin and Kilborn was a witness who happened to step onto the porch 
	of another trailer when she heard the commotion.<br>
	<br>
	Robinson said Fugate was shot in front of her 7-year-old daughter.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Her daughter said, 'Please, please don't shoot me,' and he said, 'All 
	right, you can leave,' and she ran out,&quot; said Robinson, who spoke to her 
	niece after the shootings. &quot;She went and told her neighbors, and the 
	neighbors called the law.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Robinson says Neace had never appeared threatening to her, but that he was 
	known to have a violent history. Sims could not confirm that Neace had a 
	criminal record.<br>
	<br>
	County prosecutor Brendon Miller said his dealings with Neace came on 
	nonviolent issues involving child support. Neace also was in Miller's office 
	a month ago regarding a traffic ticket.<br>
	<br>
	Authorities started receiving calls from concerned neighbors around 11:30 in 
	the roadside mobile home park outside Jackson, about 90 miles southeast of 
	Lexington. Sims said when they arrived about an hour later, they heard a 
	single gunshot, then found Neace's body on his porch.<br>
	<br>
	They found victims in two other trailers. Other neighbors fled the trailer 
	park in fear for their lives during the shootings.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Over eggs?&quot; Robinson said. &quot;I thought that was crazy. Really. I mean just 
	because his eggs weren't hot?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Landlord Ray Rastegar said Neace received monthly disability checks from the 
	Social Security Administration, though he didn't know what his disability 
	was. Rastegar said he had begun the process of evicting Neace, who had 
	lived in the trailer park for about seven years, because he had become 
	increasingly hostile toward neighbors in recent months.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;He was unpredictable,&quot; Rastegar said. &quot;Little things would set him off.&quot;
	<br>
	<br>
	Neighbor Steve Smith saw the rampage from the window of his mobile home. 
	When he walked outside, Smith said Neace took a shot at him but missed. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;He chased his wife around that Jeep shooting at her,&quot; Smith said, pointing 
	to a shot-up SUV parked outside his mobile home. &quot;I heard her screaming and 
	running.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Smith said Neace ended up mumbling to himself on the porch of his trailer, 
	pointed the shotgun at his head and pulled the trigger. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;He's been trouble ever since he's been here,&quot; Smith said.
	<span style="background-color: #FDFFD7">&quot;He's always been trouble.&quot; </span>
