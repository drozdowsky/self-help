  	<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Panel advises depression 
	screening for U.S. teens</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The Oregonian - OregonLive.com via The Associated Press 3-29-09</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">An influential 
	government-appointed medical panel is urging doctors to routinely screen all 
	American teens for depression -- a bold step that acknowledges that 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFD5">nearly 2 
	million teens are affected by this debilitating condition</span>. <br>
	<br>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFD5">Most are undiagnosed and untreated</span>, said the panel, the
	<u>U.S. Preventive Services 
	Task Force</u>, which sets guidelines for doctors on a host of health 
	issues. <br>
	<br>
	The task force recommendations appear in April's issue of the journal 
	<u>Pediatrics</u>. And they go farther than the <u>American Academy of Pediatrics</u>' 
	own guidance for teen depression screening. <br>
	<br>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFB9">An estimated 6 percent of U.S. 
	teenagers are clinically depressed</span>. Evidence shows that detailed but 
	simple questionnaires can accurately diagnose depression in primary-care 
	settings such as a pediatrician's office. <br>
	<br>
	The task force said that when followed by treatment, including 
	psychotherapy, screening can help improve symptoms and help kids cope. 
	Because depression can lead to persistent sadness, social isolation, school 
	problems and even suicide, <span style="background-color: #FFFFB9">screening to treat it early is crucial,</span> the panel 
	said. <br>
	<br>
	The task force is an independent panel of experts convened by the federal 
	government to establish guidelines for treatment in primary-care. Its new 
	guidance goes beyond the pediatrics academy, which advises pediatricians to 
	ask teen patients questions about depression. Other doctor groups advise 
	screening only high-risk youngsters. <br>
	<br>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFD5">Because depression is so common</span>, 
	&quot;you will miss a lot if you only screen high-risk groups,&quot; said Dr. Ned 
	Calonge, task force chairman and chief medical officer for <u>Colorado's 
	Department of Public Health and Environment. </u> <br>
	<br>
	The group recommends research-tested screening tests even for kids without 
	symptoms. It cited two questionnaires that focus on depression tip-offs, 
	such as mood, anxiety, appetite and substance abuse. <br>
	<br>
	Calonge stressed that the panel does not want its advice to lead to drug 
	treatment alone, particularly anti-depressants that have been linked with 
	increased risks for suicidal thoughts.
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFB9">Routine depression testing should 
	only occur if psychotherapy is also readily available</span>, the panel 
	said. Calonge said screening once yearly likely would be enough. <br>
	<br>
	The recommendations come at a pivotal time for treatment of depression and 
	other mental health problems in children. <br>
	<br>
	Recently passed federal mental health equity legislation mandates equal 
	coverage for mental and physical ailments in insurance plans offering both. 
	The law is expected to prompt many more adults and children to seek mental 
	health care. <br>
	<br>
	Yet at the same time <span style="background-color: #FFFFB9">psychiatrists 
	specializing in treating children and teens are scarce</span>. A separate 
	report, also released Monday in the <u>Pediatrics</u> journal, says primary care 
	doctors including pediatricians and family physicians will need to get more 
	involved in mental health care. <br>
	<br>
	That report is from the pediatrics academy and the
	<u>American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
	Psychiatry</u>. The groups say pediatricians should routinely consult with 
	child psychiatrists, including working in the same office when possible. And 
	it says insurers should compensate pediatricians for any mental health 
	services they provide. <br>
	<br>
	Dr. Alan Axelson, a Pittsburgh psychiatrist who co-authored the second 
	report, praised the task force recommendations and said pediatricians can 
	play a key role. <br>
	<br>
	Because children's families often get to know their pediatricians, having 
	those doctors offer mental health screening can help make it seem less 
	stigmatizing, Axelson said. <br>
	<br>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFD5">Most pediatricians aren't trained to 
	do psychotherapy</span>, but they can prescribe depression medication and 
	monitor patients they've referred to others for therapy, he said. <br>
	<br>
	Dr. Ted Epperly, president of the <u>American Academy of Family Physicians</u>, 
	said his group strongly supports both Pediatrics reports. <br>
	<br>
	While primary care doctors have full plates just dealing with physical 
	ailments, many recognize the importance of providing mental health services 
	-- and many already do, Epperly said. <br>
	<br>
	It isn't always as time-consuming as it might seem; some screening 
	questionnaires can be filled out by patients in the waiting room, Epperly 
	said. Doctors can easily spot any red flags. <br>

&nbsp;teen depression risk: study<br>
	<font size="2">2/2/09 AFP via Yahoo News</font></b></font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON (AFP) – Spending more 
	hours watching television or playing video games as a teenager may lead to 
	depression in young adults, according to a study published Monday.<br>
	<br>
	Researchers looked at the exposure to electronic media of 4,142 adolescents 
	who were not depressed when the study began in 1995, before DVDs and the 
	Internet were widely used.<br>
	<br>
	The teens reported an average of <span style="background-color: #FFFFD5">
	5.68 hours of media exposure per day</span>, including 2.3 hours of 
	television, 2.34 hours of radio, 0.62 hours of videocassettes and 0.41 hours 
	of computer games.<br>
	<br>
	Seven years later, when the participants were an average of 21.8 years old, 
	308 of them (7.4 percent) had developed symptoms consistent with depression.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;In the fully adjusted models, participants had significantly greater odds 
	of developing depression by follow-up for each hour of daily television 
	viewed,&quot; wrote the authors of the study published in the <u>Archives of General Psychiatry</u> 
	journal.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;In addition, those reporting higher total media exposure had significantly 
	greater odds of developing depression for each additional hour of daily 
	use,&quot; said the study, led by Brian Primack of the <u>University of Pittsburgh School of 
	Medicine.</u><br>
	<br>
	Young women were found to be less likely to develop symptoms of depression 
	than young men when exposed to the same amount of electronic media.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFB9">Depression, the leading cause of 
	non-fatal disability worldwide, commonly begins in adolescence or young 
	adulthood</span>, the article explained.<br>
	<br>
	The authors noted that time spent engaging with electronic media may replace 
	time that could be spent on social, athletic or intellectual activities that 
	could guard against depression.<br>
	<br>
	Messages transmitted through electronic media may encourage aggression, 
	inspire fear or anxiety and hamper identity development, they added.<br>
	<br>
	Being exposed to media at night may also disrupt sleep important for 
	emotional and cognitive development.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;When high amounts of television or total exposure are present, a broader 
	assessment of the adolescent's psychosocial functioning may be appropriate, 
	including screening for current depressive symptoms and for the presence of 
	additional risk factors,&quot; the authors said.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;If no other immediate intervention is indicated, encouraging patients to 
	participate in activities that promote a sense of mastery and social 
	connection may promote the development of protective factors against 
	depression.&quot;<br>

	These two studies by reputable social scientists summaries are available to

	about these reports:</font></p>
	<ul>

		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">

		<li>
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Neither study notes the possibility that 
		some (or much?) &quot;depression&quot; is really <u>grief</u>. As a whole, our

		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
		<font face="Arial" size="2">The first study makes no attempt to assess
