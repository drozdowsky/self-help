														Researchers are studying 
														a pervasive 
														psychological phenomenon 
														in which &quot;Oh man we've 
														got to finish doing the 
														taxes this weekend...&quot; 
														C'mon, admit it. Your 
														train of thought has 
														derailed like that many 
														times. It's just 
														mind-wandering. We all 
														do it, and surprisingly 
														often, whether we're 
														struggling to avoid it 
														or not.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Mainstream psychology 
														hasn't paid much 
														attention to this common 
														mental habit. But a 
														spate of new studies is 
														chipping away at its 
														mysteries and scientists 
														say the topic is 
														beginning to gain 
														visibility.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Someday, such research 
														may turn up ways to help 
														students keep their 
														focus on textbooks and 
														lectures, and drivers to 
														keep their minds on the 
														road. It may reveal ways 
														to reap payoffs from the 
														habit.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														And it might shed light 
														on 
														<u>attention deficit 
														hyperactivity disorder</u>
														which can include an 
														unusually severe 
														inability to focus that 
														causes trouble in 
														multiple areas of life.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														More generally, 
														scientists say, 
														<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">mind-wandering is worth 
														studying because it's 
														just too common to 
														ignore.</span></font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Michael Kane, a 
														psychologist at the 
														<u>University of North 
														Carolina</u> at Greensboro, 
														sampled the thoughts of 
														students at eight random 
														times a day for a week. 
														He found that on 
														average, they were not 
														thinking about what they 
														were doing 30 percent of 
														the time.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														For some students it was 
														between 80 and 90 
														percent of the time. Out 
														of the 126 participants, 
														only one denied any 
														mind-wandering at the 
														sampled moments.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														<span style="background-color: #FCFFB7">Prior work has also 
														turned up average rates 
														of 30 percent to 40 
														percent in everyday 
														life.</span></font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														&quot;If you want to 
														understand people's 
														mental lives, this is a 
														phenomenon we ought to 
														be thinking about,&quot; Kane 
														said.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Of course, a lot of 
														mind-wandering is 
														harmless, as when you 
														think about a work 
														problem while munching a 
														cheeseburger. The 
														problem comes when it 
														distracts you from 
														something you should be 
														paying attention to.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The result of that can 
														be tragic</span>. Kane noted 
														the 2003 case of a 
														college professor who 
														drove to work in Irvine, 
														Calif., one hot August 
														day, parked and went to 
														his office. Whatever was 
														going through his mind, 
														he'd lost track of the 
														fact that his 
														10-month-old son was in 
														the back seat. The boy 
														died in the heat. In 
														2004, virtually the same 
														thing happened in Santa 
														Ana, Calif.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														A more common task that 
														demands concentration is 
														reading. Even here, 
														people's minds wander 15 
														to 20 percent of the 
														time, said Jonathan 
														Schooler of the 
														<u>University of British 
														Columbia</u> in Vancouver, 
														Canada. And they often 
														don't realize it, he 
														said.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														He and colleagues had 
														college students read 
														passages from &quot;War and 
														Peace&quot; and other books. 
														The volunteers pushed a 
														button every time they 
														noticed their thoughts 
														straying, and that 
														happened regularly, 
														Schooler said.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														But more surprisingly in 
														such experiments, when 
														the volunteers are 
														interrupted at random 
														times and asked what 
														they're thinking, &quot;we 
														regularly catch people's 
														minds wandering before 
														they've noticed it 
														themselves,&quot; Schooler 
														said. And these stealth 
														episodes appear to 
														hamper reading 
														comprehension, he said.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														In Kane's study, 
														scheduled for 
														publication later this 
														year, volunteers carried 
														devices that beeped at 
														random times and asked 
														questions about their 
														thoughts. Most of the 
														time when caught 
														mind-wandering, the 
														students said they'd 
														deliberately stopped 
														focusing on what they 
														were doing.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Their wandering thoughts 
														trained more on everyday 
														things than on 
														fantasies, and much more 
														than on worries. That's 
														similar to what previous 
														studies have found. &quot;A 
														lot of what they're 
														reporting is ... mental 
														to-do lists,&quot; Kane said.</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">But what leads to this?</span></font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														&quot;The mind is always 
														trying to wander, every 
														chance it gets,&quot; 
														Schooler said. In his 
														view, the mind has not 
														only the goal of 
														achieving whatever task 
														we're focused on, but 
														also personal goals 
														simmering outside of our 
														immediate awareness. 
														These are things like 
														making plans for the 
														future, working out 
														everyday problems, and 
														better understanding 
														oneself. Sometimes, one 
														of these goals hijacks 
														our attention. And so 
														our mind wanders. </font>
														</p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Brain-scanning evidence 
														links mind-wandering to 
														basic operation of the 
														brain. Malia Mason of 
														Harvard's Massachusetts 
														General Hospital and 
														colleagues recently 
														reported that mind-wandering taps into 
														the same circuitry that 
														people use when they're 
														told to do nothing &#8212; 
														when their brains are on 
														&quot;idle.&quot; </font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Schooler, who's studying 
														brain-wave activity 
														associated with mind 
														wandering, welcomes what 
														he sees as a surge of 
														interest in the topic. 
														He and others say 
														there's plenty to learn.
														</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">One goal is finding ways 
														to help people realize 
														when their mind is 
														wandering and bring it 
														under control,</span> Schooler 
														said. He plans to test 
														whether meditation 
														training might help.
														</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														But there's even a more 
														basic question, he said. 
														Why is the brain wired 
														to wander? What could 
														possibly be good about 
														that? </font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														&quot;Mind-wandering is 
														probably more often 
														helpful than harmful,&quot; 
														Kane said. For one 
														thing, the cost is low: 
														despite notable 
														exceptions, life usually 
														doesn't demand our full 
														attention. </font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">&quot;A lot of human daily 
														life is autopilot,&quot;</span> he 
														said. &quot;There's a whole 
														lot of what we need to 
														do that we can do 
														without thinking about 
														it, from driving to 
														eating .... We do 
														occasionally miss that 
														turn on the way home, 
														but we get through the 
														day pretty well.&quot; </font>
														</p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Given that, a mechanism 
														that encourages us to 
														devote some idle brain 
														capacity to planning and 
														solving problems &quot;seems 
														like a pretty good use 
														of time,&quot; he said.
														</font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Schooler is exploring 
														the idea that 
														mind-wandering promotes 
														creativity. &quot;It's 
														unconstrained, it can go 
														anywhere, which is sort 
														of the perfect situation 
														for creative thought,&quot; 
														he said. </font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														Mason points out that 
														just because the human 
														brain wanders doesn't 
														necessarily mean there's 
														a good reason for it. 
														Maybe, she said, the 
														mind wanders simply 
														because it can. </font>
														</p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														But even she sees an 
														upside. </font></p>
														<p>
														<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
														&quot;I can be stuck in my 
														car in traffic and not 
														go absolutely crazy 
														because I'm not stuck in 
														the here and now,&quot; she 
														said. &quot;I can think about 
														what happened last 
														night. And that's 
														great.&quot;</font></p>
