										<u><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Introduction</span></b></u><p>
										<span style="font-size: 11pt">
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The 
										prenate (i.e., the unborn baby)</span> is 
										vulnerable in a number of ways that are 
										generally unrecognized and 
										unarticulated. Most people think or 
										assume that prenates are unaware, and 
										seldom attribute to them the status of 
										being human. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I 
										recall a recent train trip, where an 
										expectant mother sat in a smoking car 
										filled with boisterous and noisy people. 
										I asked her whether she had any concern 
										for her unborn baby, and whether she 
										thought the smoke or the noise would be 
										bothersome to her unborn child. Her 
										reply was, &quot;Well of course not, my dear. 
										They are not very intelligent or awake 
										yet.&quot; </span>
										<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: #FFFFCC">
										Nothing could be further from the truth.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Theory 
										and research from the last 20 years 
										indicates that prenatal experiences can 
										be remembered, and have lifelong impact.
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										The major purpose of this article is to 
										clarify the conditions under which 
										prenatal experiences may be lifelong</span> 
										and to describe the theoretical and 
										research perspectives that are necessary 
										to understand the effects of prenatal 
										traumatization. In addition, because the 
										incidences of personal and societal 
										violence are at an all-time peak and 
										headed higher, </span></p>
										<p><u><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Interactional Trauma</span></b></u></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										effects of prenatal traumatization 
										cannot be predicted without knowledge of 
										other factors, and
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										prenatal experiences are likely to have 
										lifelong impact when they are followed 
										by reinforcing conditions or 
										interactional trauma</span>. The term 
										interactional trauma means that traumas 
										interact with each other in producing 
										their effects. In statistical analyses, 
										interactional means that the effects of 
										factors depend on the presence of other 
										factors. Both of these definitions 
										communicate the meaning of interaction 
										as it is used in this article.</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">For 
										example, it is unlikely that being stuck 
										during the birthing process causes 
										claustrophobia during adulthood. 
										However, claustrophobia is more likely 
										if similar reinforcing traumas occur. In 
										one such case that I treated, a baby who 
										had been stuck during his birth was also 
										locked in a closet for 24 hours as a 
										child, and held and choked by his 
										brother on several occasions. Several 
										points are relevant here.</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">First 
										of all, prenatal traumas provide 
										'tinctures&quot; for later experiences. 
										Stated differently,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										life experiences are perceived in terms 
										of prior and unresolved traumas</span>. 
										When a baby is stuck during birth, the 
										baby is likely to perceive later events 
										as entrapping, or to unconsciously 
										manipulate or choose life situations 
										that bring about entrapment. This 
										process is called <u>recapitulation</u>.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Secondly, similar or recapitulated 
										events, independent of perceptual 
										processes, are likely to reinforce 
										prenatal traumas, resulting in 
										relatively chronic symptoms. In the case 
										of the baby just described, childhood 
										events acted as reinforcements for the 
										birth trauma, resulting in chronic 
										claustrophobia.</span></p>
										<p>
										<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight:700">The 
										Effects of Prenatal Experiences: 
										Prenates are Conscious Aware Beings</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">During 
										the 1995 APPPAH Congress in San 
										Francisco, David Chamberlain shared a 
										case that exemplifies the consciousness 
										of prenates. In this case, a baby was 
										undergoing amniocentesis. Videotapes of 
										the amniocentesis showed that when the 
										needle was inserted into the uterus, the 
										baby turned toward the needle and batted 
										it away. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Thinking that they had seen an 
										aberration, medical staff repeated the 
										needle insertion, and again, the baby 
										batted the needle away. There are other 
										anecdotal reports that babies routinely 
										withdraw from needles as they are 
										inserted into the uterus. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">From 
										these observations, it is safe to 
										conclude that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										babies are very conscious of what is 
										happening around them</span>, 
										particularly with respect to events that 
										have impact on them personally. In her 
										book <u>From Fetus to Child</u>, 
										Alessandra Piontelli cites several cases 
										of prenatal awareness. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">She 
										describes a twin pair, at about four 
										months of gestation, who were very 
										conscious of each other, and had 
										periodic interactions. One of the twins 
										was actively aggressive, the other 
										submissive. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Whenever the dominant twin was pushing 
										or hitting, the submissive twin withdrew 
										and placed his head on the placenta, 
										appearing to rest there. In life, when 
										these twins were four years of age, they 
										had the same relationship. Whenever 
										there was fighting or tension between 
										the pair, the passive twin would go to 
										his room and put his head on his pillow. 
										He also carried a pillow and used it as 
										his &quot;security blanket,' resting on it 
										whenever his twin became aggressive.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">From 
										this and other research (such as David 
										Chamberlain's <u>Babies Remember Birth</u>, 
										and Elizabeth Noble's <u>Primal 
										Connections</u>), it seems clear that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										prenates are conscious beings and that 
										behaviors that begin in utero are also 
										likely to carry over into later life</span>.
										</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenatal Events are Remembered</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">For 
										years, it was hard to understand how 
										prenatal experiences could be 
										remembered. The central nervous system 
										is very rudimentary during the prenatal 
										period, and is not fully myelinated 
										(covered by a protective sheath). 
										However, anecdotal reports of adults 
										regressed to the prenatal period and 
										remembering prenatal events are common 
										in primal and regressive communities.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In 1970 
										Graham Farrant, an Australian medical 
										doctor, began experiencing prenatal 
										events and recording his body 
										experiences. He was quite astonished to 
										discover that he experienced most of his 
										significant prenatal memories at a 
										cellular rather than a tissue or 
										skeletal-muscular level, and he referred 
										to his recollections as cellular memory.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In 1975 
										Frank Lake, an English theologian and 
										psychiatrist, found that prenatal 
										memories stemmed from viral cells, that 
										viruses were primitive prenatal cells 
										that formed during trauma and carried 
										traumatic memories. He consistently 
										referred to prenatal memories in terms 
										of cellular memories. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Over 
										the last five years, there has been a 
										considerable amount of research done in 
										cellular biology, all of it supporting 
										the theory that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										memories can be encoded in cells</span>. 
										The research of Dr. Bruce Lipton, 
										reported in the 1995 APPPAH Congress, is 
										relevant here and supports the 
										conclusions of Farrant and Lake.</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenatal Memories May Be The Most 
										Influential</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">A group 
										of European psychologists, led by R. D. 
										Laing and Frank Lake (both now 
										deceased), contend that prenatal 
										memories are the most influential 
										because they are the first. This 
										perspective is apparent in Laing's book
										<u>The Facts of Life</u>, where he 
										writes, &quot;The environment is registered 
										from the very beginning of my life; by 
										the first one (cell) of me. What happens 
										to the first one or two of me may 
										reverberate throughout all subsequent 
										generations of our first cellular 
										parents. That first one of us carries 
										all my 'genetic' memories&quot; (p. 30).</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">He goes 
										on to say, &quot;It seems to me credible, at 
										least, that all our experience in our 
										life cycle, from cell one, is absorbed 
										and stored from the beginning, perhaps 
										especially in the beginning. How that 
										may happen I do not know. How can one 
										cell generate the billions of cells I 
										now am? We are impossible, but for the 
										fact that we are. When I look at the 
										embryological stages in my life cycle, I 
										experience what feel to me like 
										sympathetic vibrations in me now...how I 
										now feel I felt then&quot; (p 36). </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Frank 
										Lake mirrored Laing's perspectives. Lake 
										contended that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										the most formative experiences were ones 
										that occurred prenatally</span>, 
										especially during the first trimester. 
										In the U.S., Lloyd deMause has also 
										written about the social, cultural, and 
										political influences of prenatal 
										experiences, and reported on these 
										findings during the 1995 APPPAH 
										Congress.</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenates Incorporate Parental 
										Experiences and Feelings</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">From 
										his regressions with adult patients, 
										Lake also found that the most 
										influential events were maternal 
										experiences that passed biochemically 
										through the umbilical cord by means of a 
										group of chemicals called catecholamines, 
										but it is also true that prenates 
										incorporate psychic prenatal feelings 
										and experiences, especially those of 
										their mothers. Maternal emotions (and 
										paternal emotions through the mother's 
										emotional response to them) infiltrate 
										the fetus. </span></p>
										<p>
										<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: #FFFFCC">
										Research shows that what mothers 
										experience, babies also experience</span><span style="font-size: 11pt">. 
										A good example is the following case. A 
										woman's father died just prior to the 
										conception of her child. She spent the 
										whole nine months feeling depressed and 
										grieving the loss of her father. If it 
										is true that babies experience and 
										remember what their mothers experience, 
										then her baby should also have 
										experienced loss and depression, and 
										these feelings would be expected to 
										resurface during childhood and/or 
										adulthood. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">This 
										appeared to be the case. As a child, her 
										baby was periodically depressed, and 
										medical personnel could find no 
										physiological or psychological basis for 
										the depression (They were not cognizant 
										of the child's prenatal experiences). 
										When the child was depressed, he would 
										draw pictures of old and dying men in 
										caves (in pre- and perinatal psychology, 
										caves are symbolic of wombs, the place 
										where he experienced the loss of his 
										grandfather). </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">After 
										drawing, he would feel better for a 
										while, but the depression would slowly 
										return. He was not conscious of any 
										connection between his drawings and his 
										grandfather's death. The depression 
										became chronic when his parents were 
										experiencing tension (his mother and 
										father were living separately but 
										raising him together). The tension 
										symbolized the loss of his father and 
										grandfather. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">His 
										drawings sometimes depicted a little 
										girl frantically searching for dying 
										men. The little girl probably 
										represented his own feminine, the 
										mother's inner child, and/or a female 
										twin's experience of the grandfather's 
										loss. It is unlikely that grief would 
										have resurfaced as chronic depression 
										without the reinforcing conditions of 
										father loss and parental discord. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is 
										important to realize that although 
										prenates do take on the prenatal 
										experiences of their parents, they also 
										have their own unique experiences during 
										the prenatal period, independent of 
										their parents. The mechanisms of how 
										this works are not clear, but numerous 
										anecdotal reports and clinical cases 
										show that prenates have their own 
										experiences. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">For 
										example, I recall the reports of a 
										regressed child, a twin, who was 
										repeatedly subjected to verbal and 
										physical fights between his mother and 
										her boyfriend during the prenatal 
										period. He reported that his mother and 
										her boyfriend were constantly fighting, 
										but he and his twin would respond to 
										this by cuddling up and rocking while 
										the fighting went on. During the 
										fighting, they both felt quite clever 
										(to have avoided the tension) and 
										relaxed. Perhaps the presence of a 
										comforting twin can make separation from 
										parental experiences easier.</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">When 
										Reinforced, Prenatal Experiences May 
										Have Dramatic and Symptomatic Influences</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In the 
										case of the woman who lost her father 
										just prior to pregnancy, the baby 
										presumably experienced the same loss 
										that his mother experienced. In 
										addition, a very tangible and personal 
										trauma happened shortly thereafter. 
										Early in the pregnancy, when she was 
										eight weeks pregnant, the mother's 
										husband abruptly left her for another 
										woman. She was shocked by the experience 
										and felt deeply abandoned. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Presumably her unborn child felt 
										abandoned as well. Because the woman had 
										little financial security and did not 
										want to raise a child by herself, she 
										decided to abort her child. She 
										attempted several abortions, most often 
										by using the hooked or curved end of a 
										coat hanger. As a child, her baby was 
										periodically sadistic and

										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										manifestations of his sadism bore a 
										striking resemblance to his mother's 
										abortion attempts, although he was 
										consciously unaware of them. He burned 
										himself with cigarettes and gouged 
										private parts of his body with sharp 
										metal objects. His favorite sadistic 
										instrument was a fishing hook, but he 
										complained he could never buy ones that 
										were big enough. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">As a 
										young adult he was arrested thirty times 
										for assault, and his modus operandi was 
										reminiscent of his mother's attempts to 
										abort him. He usually assaulted his 
										victims when they were sleeping, by 
										using heavy braided wire with a wire 
										hook welded on the end!</span></p>

										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In the

										In addition,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">

										perceived as a burden, and as something

										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenatal and Birth Traumas Are Mirror 
										Images</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenatal traumas have two distinct 
										impacts on birth. First of all, birth is 
										often perceived and experienced in terms 
										of prenatal traumatization. For example, 
										babies who experience abortion attempts 
										are also likely to experience birth as 
										annihilative. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Babies 
										who experience near-death during 
										implantation in the womb are likely to 
										experience birth as a near-death 
										experience. Babies who experience 
										aggression or violence while in the womb 
										are likely to experience the 
										interventions of birth as aggressive and 
										violent, even though there may be no 
										such intent on the part of medical 
										personnel or parents. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Secondly, as Sheila Kitzinger has 
										documented, whenever there is 
										significant prenatal stress (trauma), 
										there is an increasing statistical 
										likelihood that birth complications will 
										occur.
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										The greater the degree of stress or 
										trauma during the prenatal period, the 
										greater the likelihood of birth 
										complications</span> and obstetrical 
										interventions. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">This is 
										exactly what occurred in case of the 
										mother whose father died just before she 
										became pregnant, and who attempted 
										several abortions. The mother had a very 
										difficult birth with long labor and many 
										complications. Many interventions were 
										used and repeated, among which were 
										inductions, augmentations, sedations, 
										analgesias, anesthesias, forceps, 
										episiotomy, intensive care placement, 
										and respiration. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It 
										should be pointed out that the severity 
										of symptoms in the present case is due 
										to the additional and reinforcing 
										traumas, all involving loss, 
										abandonment, and aggression. When the 
										baby was three months old, the mother 
										took him shopping in a stroller, forgot 
										that he was with her, left him in an 
										aisle of the store, and only realized 
										her error hours later. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In 
										addition to this,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										she had a boyfriend who was repeatedly 
										and physically abusive with her son 
										during his early childhood</span>. These 
										multiple and reinforcing traumas 
										manifested in his childhood and 
										adulthood as aggression and violence.</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenatal and Birth Traumas Impair 
										Bonding at Birth</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In 
										addition to posing a risk of birth 
										traumatization, prenatal traumas have 
										another and more insidious impact.
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										When traumas occur prior to or during 
										birth, the quantity and quality of 
										bonding is radically reduced</span>. 
										This reduction occurs for two reasons. 
										The first has to do with the defensive 
										dulling of mind and body, a natural 
										defense against (Bloch, 1985). </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">This 
										self-anesthetization occurs because of 
										the hormonal changes that normally occur 
										in the body during and after trauma and 
										shock. When the body and mind are 
										dulled, and when the body is exhausted 
										from stress, the quantity and quality of 
										bonding are lessened. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										second impact has to do with the failure 
										of parents and others to acknowledge 
										traumatization, which diminishes the 
										bonding process even further. When 
										traumas occur, there is a critical 
										period of time afterward during which 
										humans require understanding, 
										acknowledgment, and compassion in order 
										for shock to subside and healing to 
										begin. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										However, it is rare for babies to 
										receive understanding, acknowledgment, 
										and compassion after their prenatal and 
										birth traumas, simply because no one 
										knows or believes that traumas have 
										taken place. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">As has 
										been verified in my own clinical 
										research with babies,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										unacknowledged traumas create distrust 
										in babies</span>, and this significantly 
										impedes the bonding process. In 
										contrast, it is informative to witness 
										the level and depth of bonding in babies 
										who have not been traumatized, or whose 
										traumatization is being seen and 
										acknowledged. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										bonding is noteworthy by its depth, 
										intensity, and duration. One only has to 
										witness such bonding to realize that 
										bonding is significantly reduced and 
										altered by the presence of 
										unacknowledged and unresolved 
										traumatization. </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">Lack 
										of Bonding Predisposes the Individual to 
										Aggression and Violence </span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In my 
										work with infants over the past 25 
										years, I have discovered some important 
										interrelationships between prenatal 
										trauma, birth trauma, bonding, and 
										aggression. The first interrelationship 
										is that birth actively impairs the 
										bonding process because many aspects of 
										the birthing process are psychologically 
										and physically painful for babies.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Medical 
										exams and medical tests are often 
										experienced by babies as unnecessary, 
										invasive, and painful, and this is 
										rarely acknowledged. Medical personnel 
										routinely separate babies from parents 
										after birth, and separation is often 
										experienced as terrifying abandonment.</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;Placement 
										in intensive care is frequently 
										experienced as terrifying, lonely, 
										overstimulating, and painful 
										abandonment. Anesthetization is 
										particularly impactful on bonding 
										because residual amounts of anesthesia 
										are common in babies, even hours and 
										days after birth, and anesthesia makes 
										babies (and mothers) numb and therefore 
										less available to the bonding process.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Epidurals were thought to be superior to 
										other anesthetics because they would not 
										inhibit the bonding process as much, but 
										research shows that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										mothers who receive epidurals show less 
										attachment to their babies than mothers 
										who do not</span>. These are some 
										examples of the effects of birth trauma 
										on bonding. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In all 
										cases bonding is affected because it is 
										difficult for babies to trust their 
										parents when their parents do not 
										accurately perceive or acknowledge their 
										prenatal and birth traumas. In general,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										the greater the number and severity of 
										unacknowledged prenatal and birth 
										traumas, the greater the impact on 
										bonding</span>. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Secondly, when traumas are largely 
										untreated, the influence on bonding is 
										exacerbated because the traumatized 
										infant remains in a defensive stance 
										with respect to the world, and does not 
										&quot;let the world touch him.&quot; Many parents 
										report to me that their babies are very 
										independent, but this is often a cover 
										for defensiveness. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Such 
										babies act as if they are OK and do not 
										need comforting or support. They do not 
										easily let themselves be comforted and 
										held, either pushing their parents away 
										and/or ignoring their attempts to 
										comfort and console them. Many times 
										they will only let their parents comfort 
										them after considerable resistance.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Third, 
										it is important to realize that a lack 
										of bonding may be sufficient, in and of 
										itself, to create aggression and 
										violence. This surprising fact has been 
										brought to light by various researchers. 
										For example, Magid and McKelvey (1988) 
										reported that </span>
										<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: #FFFFCC">
										children with severe bonding 
										difficulties do not develop a 
										conscience, and perform asocial or 
										antisocial acts without remorse. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Felicity De Zulueta (1993) summarized 
										research in the field of bonding and 
										attachment, and concluded that violent 
										aggression is the result of damaged 
										bonding. She writes, &quot;One of the most 
										important outcomes of...studies on 
										attachment behavior is the emerging link 
										between psychological trauma, such as 
										loss (of a bond)...and destructive or 
										violent behavior.&quot; She concludes that 
										the more damage that is done to bonding, 
										the greater the likelihood of aggression 
										and violence during childhood and 
										adulthood. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Fourth, 
										it is clear from the observations of 
										clinical researchers that the 
										probability of societal aggression and 
										violence are increased greatly by the 
										presence of aggression or violence 
										during the pre- and perinatal periods of 
										development. Prenates pick up on 
										aggressive and violent energies, and are 
										likely to repeat what they experience in 
										their prenatal life space.</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">What 
										Kinds of Pre- and Perinatal Experiences 
										Underline Aggression and Violence?</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">As a 
										way of determining the prenatal, 
										etiological bases for violence and 
										aggression, I posed a basic question to 
										a number of experts in the field, among 
										whom were R. D. Laing, Frank Lake, 
										Barbara Valassis, Barbara Findelsen, 
										Stan Grof, Michael Irving, and others. I 
										asked them to report on the kinds of 
										regressive experiences that their 
										aggressive and violent patients had 
										uncovered and/or reported, and that were 
										central in the success of treatment.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Among 
										their varied responses were common 
										threads of consensus, among which were:</span></p>
										<ul>
											<li>
											<p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0">
											<span style="font-size: 11pt">pre- 
											and perinatal experiences were 
											paramount in aggression and 
											violence;</span></li>
											<li>
											<p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0">
											<span style="font-size: 11pt">
											childhood experiences seemed to

											<span style="font-size: 11pt">
											aggression and violence were related

											<p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0">

											consistently related to aggression

											<li>
											<p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0">
											<span style="font-size: 11pt">
											certain pre- and perinatal traumas 
											were consistently related to 
											aggression and violence. </span>
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">These 
										experiences are described below. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In 
										reading through these experiences, it is 
										important to remember several basic 
										principles, references above. First of 
										all, multiple prenatal traumas are more 
										likely to result in violence and 
										aggression than single traumas. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Secondly, bonding deficiencies are 
										directly related to aggression and 
										violence. The greater the degree of 
										bonding deficits, the greater the 
										likelihood of violence and aggression.</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Third, 
										prenatal traumas that involve loss, 
										abandonment, or rejection are more 
										likely to impact bonding than other 
										traumatic themes, and are also more 
										likely to result in the complete absence 
										of bonding than traumas involving other 
										themes. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Finally, the direct exposure to 
										aggression and violence during the 
										prenatal period is highly predictive of 
										violence and aggression during 
										adulthood. The old adage, &quot;Children 
										learn what they live,&quot; is relevant here. 
										Like children, prenates &quot;learn what they 
										live,&quot; and
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										prenates subjected to aggression and 
										violence are likely to manifest the same 
										in their adult lives.</span> </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Conception</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">When 
										clients who have problems with 
										aggression and violence are regressed, 
										they frequently encounter the experience 
										of conception. They report that they are 
										conscious of traumatic issues outside of 
										themselves, in their family or immediate 
										surroundings. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										most frequently mentioned traumas 
										involved forced sex, manipulated sex, 
										date rape, rape, substance abuse, 
										physical abuse, dismal familial, social, 
										or cultural conditions, and personal or 
										cultural shame, such as when children 
										are conceived out of wedlock. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">They 
										often experience biological encounters 
										as sperm and/or eggs which involve 
										intense aggression, annihilation, death, 
										power, and/or rejection. To cite an 
										example of traumatic conception, one 
										child was conceived out of wedlock in a 
										small religious community where such 
										things were disdained. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Her 
										mother experienced shame, guilt, and 
										public ridicule before deciding to &quot;keep 
										her,&quot; and
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										the child experienced the same guilt, 
										shame, and ridicule that her mother did</span>. 
										The public ridicule was experienced as 
										particularly annihilating and hostile. 
										This led to character patterns of 
										self-righteousness, self-ridicule, 
										masochism, and hostility. </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Implantation</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Implantation is the biological process 
										whereby the conceptus attaches itself to 
										the uterine wall, and is a vital and 
										precarious stage of embryological 
										development. Prior to and during 
										implantation, regressed patients report 
										that they experienced the terror of 
										being near death. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">They 
										report feeling unwanted and that they 
										have no place to go, no place to belong, 
										and 'decide' that the world is a hostile 
										and unsafe place. They often collapse in 
										hopelessness, retaliate in rage, 
										fluctuate between these two extremes, 
										and/or manifest intense rescue complexes 
										(the need to rescue others and/or be 
										rescued). </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Christ's life was, in many ways, a 
										metaphor of implantation. There was &quot;no 
										room in the Inn,&quot; and He had no place 
										that He belonged. And as the Bible 
										declares, His life was manifested in 
										order for Him to save and rescue 
										mankind. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Many 
										individuals with problems of aggression 
										report the loss of a twin. Their 
										problems with aggression typically have 
										to do with masochism and/or neurotic 
										self criticism. Embryological research 
										indicates that loss of a twin may be 
										much more likely than previously 
										thought. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Embryologists estimate that between 30% 
										to 80% of conceptions are actually 
										multiple (i.e. twins) rather than 
										single. Since the rate of birthed twins 
										is far less than 30% to 80% percent, 
										embryologists conclude
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										that many conceptions involved the death 
										of one or more twins</span>. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">This 
										can be prior to or during implantation, 
										although some happen after implantation. 
										People who experience the loss of a twin 
										manifest several common dynamics. First 
										of all, there is an ineffable but 
										profound sense of loss, despair, and 
										rage. These feelings are usually held 
										in, but are sometimes acted out against 
										others. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Secondly, there is a chronic but 
										unarticulated fear that loss will happen 
										again, and pervasive insecurity. The 
										threat of loss is defended against by 
										distancing from others, or by engaging 
										in codependent relationships. Third, the 
										ability to bond with others is deficient 
										or neurotic because there is a lack of 
										trust in relationships, or disbelief 
										that relationships will last. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Fourth, 
										there is often an over compliance in 
										life, based on the unconscious feeling 
										that &quot;if I don't do what is expected or 
										wanted, I will die.&quot; Over compliance 
										feeds hostility and aggression toward 
										others, since one cannot take care of 
										oneself when constantly complying with 
										others. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Finally, prenatal experiences of near 
										death and/or loss are sometimes turned 
										against oneself or others, resulting in 
										sadistic and masochistic behaviors, 
										criminal violence, or sadomasochistic 
										thinking and behavior. </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Discovery of Unwanted Pregnancy</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">When 
										aggressive clients regress to the 
										prenatal period, they frequently and 
										spontaneously regress to the time the 
										pregnancy was discovered, and many of 
										them are surprised to find that they 
										were unwanted. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										discovery of being unwanted typically 
										leads to the realization that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										lifelong episodes of depression, 
										self-destructiveness, or aggression are 
										a direct expression of prenatal 
										rejection</span>. They typically report 
										that they can trust only themselves, and 
										that their whole lives have been geared 
										toward denying or finding the acceptance 
										and love that they did not receive as 
										prenates. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										percentage of aggressive clients who 
										were unwanted at the time of discovery 
										is quite high, and has important 
										implications for bonding disorders. 
										Typical responses to being unwanted are 
										to collapse into helplessness and 
										hopelessness, to rage at others and the 
										world's injustice, and/or refuse to 
										engage in life.</span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenatal Aggression</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										majority of adults with problems in 
										aggression learn that they were unwanted 
										at the time of discovery, but many of 
										them also learn that they were exposed 
										to other forms of aggression during the 
										pre- and perinatal period. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Some 
										common forms of aggression are warfare, 
										gang fights, domestic violence, 
										conception through rape, physical or 
										sexual abuse of parents or siblings, 
										annihilative energies, intrauterine 
										toxicities, and/or abortion attempts.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Prenates who experience one or more of 
										these aggressive conditions are at risk 
										for manifesting aggression and violence, 
										and the greater the number of 
										conditions, the greater the likelihood 
										of aggression and violence. </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Adoption</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Adoption trauma refers to a broad range 
										of painful experiences that are common 
										to adoption. When children are adopted,

										abortion plans with no attempts, or 
										abortion ideations but no plans. </span>

										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Adoption trauma has many different 
										levels. The lowest level occurs when 
										parents want their children but 
										reluctantly give them up for adoption 
										because external circumstances dictate. 
										A higher level occurs when parents do 
										not want their children and seriously 
										consider abortion. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										highest level occurs when parents are 
										unequivocally opposed to having 
										children, when pregnancies are resented, 
										when abortions, are attempted, when 
										children are put up for adoption, and 
										when children are fostered a number of 
										times. At high risk for aggression are 
										children who experience the severest 
										levels of adoption trauma. </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">Pre- 
										and Perinatal Medical Procedures</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">When 
										prenates experience severe forms of 
										traumatization as described above, they 
										are also likely to perceive subsequent 
										events in similar contexts. This is 
										especially true when subsequent events 
										are stressful life transitions (such as 
										birth, adolescence, first jobs, new 
										relationships, etc.), and/or when 
										subsequent events are symbolically 
										similar to traumatizing events. </span>

										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">For 
										example, if prenates experience prenatal 
										violence, then they are likely to 
										experience life transitions (such as 
										birth) in violent ways. Freud called

										definitions, recapitulation means that
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										prenatal experiences shape how 
										subsequent life experiences are 
										perceived</span>. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The

										who had only limited prenatal traumas, 
										but which nevertheless influenced her 
										baby's perceptions and experiences of 
										the birthing process. The mother was 28

										conceive a child. Her own mother had had 
										difficulty conceiving children, so she 
										was anxious about her ability to 
										conceive. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">She 
										wanted to have a child, and in spite of 
										being unmarried, conceived a child with 
										her boyfriend, who was also ambivalent.

										boyfriend's father had been abusive to 
										him during the prenatal period). </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">A 
										series of beatings occurred, after which 
										the mother fled. She spent the remainder 
										of her pregnancy in a distant and safe 
										place, under conditions that were close 
										to &quot;ideal.&quot; She was attentive to 
										herself, her body, and to her baby. She 
										meditated daily and earned income from 
										work she did at home. She had an 
										extensive and supportive family system 
										as well as friends, and the remainder of 
										the pregnancy was uneventful in terms of 
										other stresses and traumas. She devoted 
										time to her unborn baby every day, 
										talking and singing to him, and doing 
										bonding exercises. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">She 
										gave birth at home, and described the 
										birth as short and simple, with no 
										complications. In spite of having a 
										largely positive pregnancy and an easy 
										birth, the early abusive experiences 
										haunted her and her baby. In particular, 
										her baby experienced the birth as very 
										traumatic. (This is not an unusual 
										event, even when mothers describe births 
										as simple and uneventful). </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">This 
										was evident in childhood memories of his 
										third trimester and birth.
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										He experienced his mother's jogging 
										during the third trimester as abusive</span>, 
										saying that his head bounced painfully 
										on his mother's pelvic bones. He 
										experienced the perineal massages (given 
										repeatedly during birth) as intrusive, 
										and the contractions as abusive and 
										violent. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">He was 
										aware of his mother's physical pain, 
										felt the birth was hurting her, and felt 
										guilty that he could not protect her. In 
										short, all of his birth feelings 
										appeared to be overlays and 
										manifestations of his unresolved abuse 
										traumas from the first trimester. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is 
										important to realize that, even more so 
										than children or adults, prenates 
										perceive and interpret life experiences 
										in terms of past experiences. This is so 
										because prenates do not have sufficient 
										neurological integrity or adequate life 
										experiences to assist in discriminating 
										between current and historical 
										realities. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">When 
										prenates experience abandonment, 
										rejection, violence, or abuse, as has 
										been described in this paper, they 
										routinely bring these experiences to 
										bear during the birthing process. 
										Amniocentesis needles and chorionic 
										villae catheters are commonly perceived 
										as aggressive, annihilating, and/or 
										rejecting instruments. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Anesthetic procedures are often 
										perceived as attempts to disempower or 
										to poison (a reflection of abortion 
										trauma). Augmentations (inductions and 
										&quot;breaking waters&quot;) are usually 
										experienced as boundary violations. 
										Forceps and vacuum extractions are often 
										perceived as attempts to control or 
										annihilate. Contractions are often 
										perceived as attempts to annihilate, 
										destroy, or impede. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">For 
										example, one adult who had been exposed 
										to chemical and mechanical abortion 
										attempts (his mother had taken low-dose 
										cyanide pills and repeatedly pummeled 
										her abdomen and uterus) experienced 
										contractions as attempts to beat him to 
										death, and experienced anesthesia 
										administrations as attempts to poison 
										him. </span></p>
										<p>
										<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: #FFFFCC">
										It is vital that medical and obstetrical 
										personnel understand the importance and 
										relevance of pre- and perinatal traumas</span><span style="font-size: 11pt">, 
										and understand that babies are likely to 
										experience the birthing process in terms 
										of prior traumatizations. This means 
										that birth can be very traumatic, simply 
										on the basis of personal history. If 
										this fact were known, then medical 
										interventions could be limited to 
										situations where they were absolutely 
										necessary, or medical interventions 
										could be humanized in a variety of ways.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Some 
										useful procedures might be asking the 
										permission of babies to implement 
										procedures and getting responses through 
										the mother's intuition, letting babies 
										know that they might experience pains 
										and discomforts, and empathizing in 
										terms of prior traumas, letting babies 
										know that birth is a difficult 
										transition with the potential for 
										negative and overwhelming feelings and 
										acknowledging babies post-birth emotions 
										as legitimate expressions of a difficult 
										birthing process all this could help to 
										minimize potential trauma. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is 
										also important to acknowledge the 
										positive aspects of birthing, the wonder 
										and joy that belongs to the birthing 
										process. Few births are entirely 
										difficult, and few are completely free 
										from trauma or pain. We need to 
										acknowledge the whole gamut of human 
										experiences as they unfold during the 
										birthing process. </span></p>
										<p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Treatment</span></b></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is 
										important that pre- and perinatal 
										traumas be treated as early as possible. 
										This is so because, as previously 
										discussed, early traumas shape how 
										subsequent events will be perceived and 
										experienced.
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										If treatment occurs early on, during 
										gestation or the first year, then 
										childhood experiences can be freed from 
										prenatal influences</span>, and children 
										can live their lives unencumbered by the 
										bonds of trauma. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										effects of trauma have been described 
										elsewhere (Emerson, 1992, 1994).
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										Unresolved traumas affect the spiritual 
										and psychological development of 
										children</span>. In contrast, children 
										who had no trauma, or whose traumas have 
										been resolved, are clearly unique in the 
										following ways. They are more 
										spiritually evolved, manifest higher 
										levels of human potential, and are 
										developmentally precocious. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">They 
										exhibit higher self-esteem and 
										intelligence test scores, and they are 
										more empathic, emotionally mature, 
										cooperative, creative, affectionate, 
										loving, focused, and self-aware than 
										untreated and traumatized children 
										(Emerson, 1993). </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The 
										fact that pre- and perinatal traumas 
										shape how subsequent life events are 
										experienced does not mean that childhood 
										experiences, in and of themselves, are 
										unimportant in terms of human 
										development. On the contrary, childhood 
										experiences are very important in 
										determining and shaping who children 
										will become. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is 
										precisely because childhood experiences 
										are so important that it is vital to 
										free childhood from the bonds of pre- 
										and perinatal trauma. If these traumas 
										can be resolved before childhood, then 
										childhood has the opportunity to be 
										experienced on its own, without 
										traumatic influence from the prenatal 
										period, and without the defensive forces 
										that inhibit feelings of safety, 
										security, and growth. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Furthermore, children can be freed to 
										exhibit and manifest their own unique 
										human potential, to utilize their own 
										inherent levels of intelligence, and to, 
										become themselves, unencumbered by prior 
										traumas. In addition to these benefits, 
										society can be freed from the increasing 
										burden of aggression and violence.
										</span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										According to statistics reported at the 
										1995 APPPAH Congress,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										violence and aggression are on the rise</span>, 
										and are reaching epidemic proportions. 
										Therapists who specialize in anger 
										resolution report that about one client 
										in five carries a significant degree of 
										anger and rage. Aggression and violence 
										are on the rise, and are extremely 
										costly in terms of human lives, in terms 
										of financial and budgetary 
										considerations (prisons, jails, and law 
										enforcement are very costly, and deprive 
										our school systems of needed finances), 
										and in terms of the safe and efficient 
										functioning of our institutions. </span>
										</p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">These 
										violent feelings are directed toward 
										self and others, and are very difficult 
										to resolve for the following reasons. 
										First of all,
										<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
										most therapists do not realize that 
										anger and rage, at their deepest levels, 
										are caused by pre- and perinatal 
										traumas, </span>and are related to 
										perinatal bonding deficits. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Secondly, most clinicians fail to 
										realize that anger and rage cannot be 
										resolved solely by talking therapies. 
										Instead, anger and rage require physical 
										and emotional release. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Third, 
										anger and rage are inextricably 
										intertwined with low self-esteem, shame, 
										guilt, disempowerment, and forgiveness. 
										These concepts need to be understood and 
										recognized in the treatment of 
										aggressive disorders. </span></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
										Finally, the ultimate resolution of rage 
										and anger requires that relevant pre- 
										and perinatal traumas be uncovered, 
										encountered, catharted, repatterned, and 
										integrated into consciousness. 
										Additional aspects of treatment should 
										include opportunities for re-bonding, 
										i.e., for bonding in ways that were 
										impossible at the time of 
										traumatization, or bonding in ways that 
										were inhibited by unresolved traumas.
										</span></p>

										Association for Pre- and Perinatal 
										Psychology and Health, the International
