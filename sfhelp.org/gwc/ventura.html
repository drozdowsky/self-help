    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<b>Marriage is the most dangerous form of love</b>. Count the casualties and you
    know. It turns many people to stone. We all have seen that. Our society is
    cracking under the weight of many stone- lives. We all know that. But will
    we, or will we not, discover all that a man and woman can be? Marriage is
    not the answer, but it is the most demanding way to live the question.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t ask questions. Live them.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the unrelenting demand of an active inner life. If we shirk that
    demand we begin to turn to stone.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here are the speculations on a flux, a life, a dare that I sometimes
    refer to as &quot;my marriage.&quot; They are the notes of a man who, only a
    bit more than two years ago, joined in &quot;wed-lock&quot; (the phrase is
    not without its sinister echo) with a woman and her young son. The notes of
    a man who, at the time, only dimly realized that in marrying with these two
    others he was marrying no less than -- everything.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everything,&quot; in Greek, is the word pan, and pan is what they
    called the wildest, most elemental of the gods, the god least subject to
    placation - the god that was never housebroken. No wonder they sang and
    danced at that wedding!</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our life leads separate lives.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am &quot;married,&quot; as they say in this world, to Jan, who is
    &quot;married&quot; to me - &quot;two old fuckers,&quot; as she puts it.
    She, forty. Me, thirty-nine. And Brendan, eleven now (her child but, as I
    find myself putting it in conversation, &quot;our boy&quot;). It is now, as
    I’ve said, two years since I married these two people and they married me - three separate acts. Three very different inner ceremonies 
	- Jan’s,
    Brendan’s, and mine - taking place within the one ceremony that joined
    us. Or that symbolized our joining. For in marriage symbols often come
    first: first the instinct to join, then the symbolic joining, then the
    relentless reality of trying to join.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far the above would be described by most systems of thought - psychological,
    sociological, whatever - with the phrase: &quot;The two of them (or the
    three of them) are married.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pathetically useless phrase for the description of any reality I know. We’d
    best leave it behind right now. For one thing, it implies that there are
    only three people living in our apartment.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But living in this small apartment, there are, to begin with, three entirely
    different sets of twos: Michael and Jan, Jan and Brendan, Brendan and
    Michael. Each set, by itself, is very different from the other, and each is
    different from Jan-Brendan-Michael together. But go further:</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brendan-Jan-Michael having just gotten up ‘for breakfast is a very
    different body politic, with different varying tensions, depending on
    whether it’s a school day or not, from Brendan-Jan-Michael driving home
    from seeing, say, El Norte, which is different still from driving home from
    Ghostbusters, and all of them are different from Brendan-Jan-Michael going
    to examine a possible school for Brendan. The Brendan who gets up at
    midnight needing to talk to Michael is quite different from the Brendan who,
    on another night, needs suddenly to talk to Jan, and both are vastly
    different from the Brendan who often keeps his own counsel. The Michael
    writing at three in the afternoon or three in the morning, isolated in a
    room with three desks and two typewriters, is very different from the
    Michael, exasperated, figuring the bills with Jan, choosing whom not to pay;
    and he in turn is very different from the half-crazed, shy drunk wondering
    just who is this &quot;raw-boned Okie girl&quot; moving to Sam Taylor’s
    fast blues one sweltering night in the Venice of L.A. at the old Taurus
    Tavern. The Jan making the decision to face her own need to write, so
    determined and so tentative at once, is very different from the
    strength-in-tenderness of the Jan who is sensual, or the sure-footed abandon
    of Jan dancing, or the screeching of the Jan who’s had it up to here.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can only be reasonably sure of several of these people – the several
    isolate Michaels, eight or fifteen of them, whom &quot;I&quot; pass from,
    day to day, night to night, dawn to almost dawn, and who at any moment in
    this much-too-small apartment might encounter a Jan or a Brendan whom I’ve
    never seen before, or whom I’ve conjectured about and can sometimes
    describe but am hard-pressed to know.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in this apartment where some might see three people living a
    comparatively quiet life, I see a huge encampment on a firelit hillside, a
    tribal encampment of selves who must always be unknowable, a mystery to any
    brief Michael, Jan, or Brendan who happens to be trying to figure it out at
    any particular moment.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who, on this hillside, subject to its many winds and weathers, who among
    these loyal but often nomadic manifestations of Jan, Michael, and Brendan,
    who among these people is &quot;married&quot;?</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are. Some are gladly and enthusiastically married, with, as the
    wonderful old phrase goes, &quot;abiding faith.&quot; Some are married but
    frightened, nervously married, hesitant as to their capacities, their
    endurance. Some are hostile to the marriage. Some are too crazy to be
    married. Some just go about their business; it doesn’t affect them, The
    hostile and the crazy and the unconcerned may be in the minority (though
    there are days when it doesn’t feel that way), yet they exist, they speak
    with our mouths sometimes, they break a dish now and then, they make a bad
    joke - they even have bad dreams, just as the parts that are gladly
    married have their good and bad dreams.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of a Henry Miller line in Tropic of Capricorn: &quot;The labyrinth
    is my happy hunting ground.&quot; I am beginning to see what he means. In
    this labyrinth, I have found that on days when I feel far-off from Jan and
    she feels rejected, it is not Jan whom I’m rejecting at all. I am
    rejecting the parts of me that feel closest to her. That is a very different
    bowl of gumbo. It indicates a very different sense of, and object of,
    responsibility.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can only guess, yet, at how many Jans there are whom I haven’t yet
    seen naked. They are the &quot;other women&quot; I’ve been interested in
    since I met her. As there are Michaels I haven’t encountered yet, and who
    come to life, surprising me, only in &quot;her&quot; presence, in the
    presence of some Jan or other.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel a leader to all my selves whom I call &quot;I&quot;. It was his idea,
    this marriage! Most of the others cheered him on, a few tried to shout him
    down. But always this whole motley crew is in my consciousness, in all its
    motliness, when &quot;I&quot; say, &quot;I am married.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been times during our marriage when have heard all our inner
    people laugh at once. That is marvelous. And nights when they have all
    rested within the same sleep. (That is more rare by far.) An days when this
    entire hillside of selves seems to follow &quot;the three of us&quot; down
    the street as though a great festival were taking place, and only we know of
    it, yet its psychic exuberance &quot;adds its light to the sum of
    light.&quot; (in the words of one Billy Kwan). This luminous, virtually
    religious sense of one’s inner life radiating into and nourishing the
    outer, wider world - I have felt it before, but never so strongly as in
    the context of this thing we rather lamely name &quot;marriage.&quot; And
    the converse: the sense of dread when I feel us failing, not only the dread
    of the private failure, but the sense that we are failing more than
    ourselves, that we are failing world that needs us not to fail. Failing not
    the crumbling world that is, but a world that some of us feel is struggling
    to be.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of the Sioux medicine man Lame Deer when, as an old man, he cried on
    a hilltop to his gods for a sign that he had not entirely failed them. That
    sense is not dead in all of us, though we may be shy to speak of it in
    ourselves and suspicious of others who do. It applies to marriage in the
    sense that, marriage doesn’t only join two people, it links their inner
    quests - the quest of each to share in, and build on, the sense of
    becoming in the world, the feeling that this era is struggling to transform
    itself into another, more fulfilling era. If only one of a married, pair can
    succeed in taking part in this transformation, both will feel a hollowness.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many who are not interested in contributing to the world’s
    transformation, but there are also many for whom such concern is an
    enormous, if often unadmitted, pressure, and we live in a society that
    hardly names this feeling, much less honors it. But even if one person in a
    marriage feels this dimension, the marriage takes on the burden of the
    concern, whether named or not.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the many ways that a &quot;relationship&quot; can feel so
    much more free. A relationship is defined as it goes along, with a lot of
    subtle and not-so-subtle negotiations as to what is and what isn’t the
    other’s business. Inner quests may, or may not, he part of that
    negotiation, whichever choice or compulsion dictates. The special thrill of
    a &quot;relationship&quot; is to select one or two (rarely more) of one’s
    many selves, and play them out with someone who is doing the same. Sometimes
    the self being lived out in the relationship is shallow, or wonderful but
    severely limited, and the relationship ends quickly; sometimes it goes
    deeper, so that as time goes on more of one’s inner selves participate,
    coming into the presence of both relating &quot;I&quot;s. A serious
    relationship usually ends when there are more secret selves participating
    than your mutual intentions can bear to accommodate.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A marriage puts you in a very different existential position. A man and a
    woman, in a marriage, are not offering each other only their favorite, or
    most convenient, or most needy selves. You marry everything, like it or not.
    If you’re living together and not married, it is still not quite the same;
    though there is a great deal invested, the door is still metaphorically
    open. Whereas marriage puts a lot more pressure on the psyche, because
    whether or not people say &quot;till death do us part,&quot; thousands of
    years of heritage have made the vow implicit. This is what marriage means in
    our collective consciousness, if not in our modern ceremonies, even now. So
    if we get married yet are still trying to follow the ways of a relationship,
    we feel undermined by the massive cultural vow we have ingested without
    wanting to. We fed closed in. Sooner or later, we feel dread.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan and I let the vow stand, said it out loud with our joined voices, as
    though to let our inner tribes of selves know what they were in for:
    &quot;till death do us part.&quot; We instinctively felt what we began both
    instantly and painfully to share: that, willingly or unwillingly, we had
    each married all of the other, including parts yet unguessed at.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage is this inclusive act, like it or not. You will not make it
    something else by saying that you want it to be something else. You will not
    make it something else by believing it should be something else. Life is not
    so simple. The psyche, collectively whole yet enormously varied within you,
    is not so easily contained. The very fact of being married will act as the
    catalyst to make your psyches both the subject and the object of the
    marriage. You can face this, and feel as though you’re leading a
    dangerous, even adventurous life; or you can avoid it, and gradually feel
    more and more unanswered by the presence of your mate.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When two people &quot;get involved,&quot; each usually has a clear (if
    usually nonverbal) idea of what he or she needs for the next stage of his or
    her growth. Virtually every serious relationship or marriage is a partially
    conscious means by which this ‘next stage&quot; Is achieved, is grown.
    Crisis time comes when one or both of them have pretty much exhausted this
    more-or-less intended stage of growth in the other and are trying to figure
    out if they can accompany each other I through yet another significant
    stage. We are living in a society in which there are few things more rare
    than two people accompanying each other through more than one significant
    run of growth.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of marriage flies in the face of this. It is, depending on your
    viewpoint, a gallantly or foolishly unrealistic challenge to one’s own
    future. Looked at this way, it’s a damned silly way to treat yourself.
    Fortunately or unfortunately, there is a phenomenon we’ve not yet alluded
    to which short-circuits these considerations. It is referred to somewhat
    vaguely as love.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We love before we know. Love comes first, and in order to answer its
    questions we have to love further. The fling turns into an

    affair turns into a relationship, the relationship turns into a marriage.
    For many people today the process of relationship has been the first stage
    of growth. Then a sad thing often happens: instead of really trying to stake
    out a further unknown territory, many try to adapt how they’ve grown
    already (the first stage) to what they feel are the conventions of marriage.
    This is usually an unmitigated disaster.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it happened, Jan and I went straight from fling into marriage. We decided
    to marry within ten days of meeting each other. This saved us the
    relationship stint of getting to not-know each other, which usually and
    sadly consists of people trying out their various selves .on one another,
    compulsively and/or intentionally, testing for commitment. That’s
    necessary for one stage of life, but like many people our age we had each
    done that many times. We decided: this time, no tests. Dance to the music.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marry it.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were we marrying each other or marrying the impulse? Good question. A
    question that can he answered only after it’s too late. Fine. For love is
    nothing, if it’s not faith. Nothing.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Brendan was born, almost nine years before Jan and I met, Jan had sent
    out announcements with that old blues refrain:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="left"><i>Baby I learned to love
      you<br>
      Honey ‘fore l called<br>
      Baby ‘fore I called your name</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love often occurs &quot;in this wise,&quot; as the old phrase as though love
    were for &quot;calling the name.&quot; And certainly &quot;to be loved is to
    feel one’s name called with an inflection that one has never heard before.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we found ourselves sending our wedding invitations that went:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="left"><i>Come on over<br>
      We ain’t fakin’<br>
      Whole lot of shakin’ goin’ on</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odd, now, to think how small a sense of foreboding we had at that Jerry Lee
    Lewis verse - though we’ve only &quot;come to blows&quot; (revealing old
    phrase, isn’t it, with its odd sense of formality?) once, and she struck
    first, broke my glasses, and I hit her then, one time, and she slumped
    against the wall, both of us feeling so soiled and ugly and wrong. How many
    bitter, gone grandmothers and grandfathers stood in the room just then,
    cackling their satisfaction at our shame? Hers, Irish; mine, Sicilian. Both
    of them traditions that did not teach us to forgive. To learn to forgive is
    to break with an unforgiving past.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pause at the word: &quot;forgive.&quot; &quot;For-to-give.&quot; Forgiveness
    is such a gift that &quot;give&quot; lives in the word. Christianist*
    tradition has tried to make it a meek and passive word; turn the other
    cheek. But the word contains the active word &quot;give,&quot; which reveals
    its truth: it involves the act of taking something of yours and handing it
    to another, so that from now on it is theirs. Nothing passive about it. It
    is an exchange. An exchange of faith: the faith that what has been done can
    be undone or can be transcended. When two people need to make this exchange
    with each other, it can be one of the most intimate acts of their lives.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgiveness is, for one thing, a promise to work at the undoing, at the
    transcending. Marriage soon enough gives all concerned the opportunity to
    forgive. There have been enough broken chairs, broken plates, and one broken
    typewriter - my beloved old Olympia portable manual, that I’d had since
    high school and smashed myself - to testify to how desperate the joined
    desperations of all the Michaels, Jans, and Brendans can be. Whole lotta
    shakin’ goin’ on, and on and on, and sometimes when you are trying to
    break through the hardened crusts inside you and inside each other, some
    dishes and typewriters arid furniture might go in the process.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most odious aspect of goody-goody, I’m-OK-you’re-OK dialogues is
    their failure to recognize that sometimes you have to scream, slam doors,
    ’break furniture, run red lights, and ride the wind even to begin to have
    the words to describe what is eating you. Sometimes meditation and dialogue
    just can’t cut it. Sometimes &quot;it&quot; just plain needs
    &quot;cutting&quot; - or at least a whole lotta shakin’. Anyone afraid
    of breaking, within and without, is in the wrong marriage. Let it all go.
    Let the winds blow. Let’s see what’s left in the morning.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is &quot;the solace of marriage&quot; - a phrase I’ve heard in
    several contexts, but am otherwise unable to comprehend. The discovery, of
    what is unbreakable among all that’s been broken. The discovery that union
    can he as irreducible as solitude. The discovery that people must share not
    only what they don’t know about each other, but what they don’t know
    about themselves.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing what we know is a puny exercise by comparison.</p>
		<p ALIGN="center">+ + +</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">* Following
    the lead of James Hillman ‘s work, I use “Christianism” in place of
    “Christianity” and “Christianist’’ in place of
    ‘‘Christian’’ wherever possible, in an attempt to get around the
    enormous bias for the religion built into our very language&quot;<br>

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did I say there were only myriads of Jans, Brendans, and Michaels
    encamped in the firelit cavern that appears to be an inexpensive old
    wood-frame duplex south of Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles? Life is
    not so simple as even that. What about the raging mob we refer to, politely,
    as &quot;the past.&quot; Nothing abstract about &quot;the past.&quot; What
    has marked you is still marking you. There is a place in us where wounds
    never heal, and where loves never end. Nobody knows much about this place
    except that it exists, feeding our dreams and reinforcing and/or haunting
    our days. In marriage, it can exist with a vengeance.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloody, half-flayed, partly dead, naked, tortured, my mother realty does
    hang on a hook in my closet, because she hangs on a hook in me. Occasionally
    I have to take her out and we do a rending dance, tearing each other bloody
    as we go, and the stuff splashes happily all over - all over Jan, several
    of the many Jans, and several of the many Brendans - and then run for the
    hills, my dears, for I am in my horror.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my several, my insistent, horrors.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are all, every one of us, full of horror. If you are getting married to
    try to make yours go away, you will succeed only in marrying your horror to
    someone else’s horror; your two horrors will have the marriage: you will
    bleed and call that love.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My closet is full of hooks, full of horrors, and I also love them, my
    horrors, and I know they love me, and they will always hang there for me,
    because they are also good for me, they are also on my side, they gave so
    much to be my horrors, they made me strong to survive. There is much in our
    new &quot;enlightened&quot; lexicon to suggest that one may move into a
    house that doesn’t have such a closet. You move into such house and think
    everything is fine until after a while you start to hear a distant
    screaming, and start to smell something funny, and realize slowly that the
    closet is there, all right, but it’s been walled over, and just when you
    need desperately to open it you find yourself faced with bricks instead of a
    door.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our cavern on this hillside in this apartment, there is quite a closet,
    where my hooks hang next to Jan’s, and to Brendan’s - it’s amazing
    how many you can accumulate at the mere age of eleven - which are also
    there for their good and harrowing reasons.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one reason it’s so odd to &quot;see the parents.&quot; Can’t
    comment on marriage and fail to mention the in-laws. Odd to see them,
    because you’ve seen them already hanging on hooks in your closet, and the
    beings splayed on those hooks are so removed from these aging,
    well-intentioned, confused souls who are the actual people. Actual, older
    people who are powerless, really, because they cannot act in their own names
    any longer. The past acts through them, no matter what they try. All they
    can do is hope to change that past; that is, to transmute its effects. Which
    is not impossible, but is so very rare.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it Is, as I say, odd to see your mate’s parents because you know them
    already, intimately, as archetypes in your mate’s sleeps. To assure this
    archetype that, yes, you really do love her fried chicken, is to enter a
    realm of comedy in which even the Marx Brothers might be frightened to
    cavort.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the horrors and the joys of what we foolishly call &quot;our
    pasts&quot; - we would more accurately call them &quot;our sleeps&quot;
    - blend, and we live the strengths and lacks of what we were, and that
    also is marriage. &quot;Your people will become my people,&quot; goes the
    old vow, and it is inescapable in the sense that I am speaking of.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a marriage to be a marriage, these encounters do not happen compulsively
    or accidentally, they happen by intention. I don’t mean that the
    encounters with all the various selves and ghosts are planned (that’s not
    possible, though they can sometimes he consciously evoked); I mean that this
    level of activity is recognized as part of the quest, part of the
    responsibility each person has for him/herself and for the other.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is the major difference between the expectations of a marriage and a
    relationship. My experience of a relationship is two people more or less
    compulsively playing musical chairs with each other’s selected inner
    archetypes. My tough street kid is romancing your honky-tonk angel. I am
    your homeless waif and you are my loving mother. I am your lost father and
    you are my doting daughter. I am your worshiper and you are my goddess. I am
    your god and you are my priestess. I am your client and you are my analyst.
    I am your intensity and you are my ground. These are some of the more garish
    of the patterns. Animus, anima, bopping on a see-saw.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These hold up well enough while the archetypal pairings behave. But what
    happens when the little boy inside him is looking for the mommy inside her
    and finds instead on this particular night a sharp-toothed analyst
    dissecting his guts? When the little girl inside her is looking for the
    daddy inside him, and finds instead a pagan worshiper who wants a goddess to
    lay with, which induces her to become a little girl play-acting a goddess to
    please the daddy who’s realty a lecherous worshiper and … little girls
    can’t come? Or when a woman is attracted to a macho-man who is secretly’
    looking to be mothered? When a man’s sexual self is in the service of an
    interior little boy, it’s not surprising that he can’t get it up or
    comes too quick. Or they’re really not there at all, they’re
    masturbating, really: men in their little-boy psyches for whom the real
    woman is just a stand-in; while the woman who happens to be in the same bed,
    an extension of their masturbation, is wondering why even though the moves
    are pretty good she doesn’t really feel slept with.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why he turns away so quickly when it’s done.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, teachers fuck pupils with excitement, analysts fuck
    clients with abandon, and people seeing each other, in bed, as gods and
    goddesses light up the sky - but the psyche is a multiple and a shifting
    entity, an none of these compassionate pairings hold stable for long. The
    archetypal mismatches soon begin, and then it’s a disaster of
    confrontations that can take years not even to sort out (it would he worth
    years to get it all sorted out) but simply to exhaust itself and fail. And
    then the cycle starts all over again with someone else.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience of a marriage is that all these same modes are present, but
    instinctively or consciously it becomes a case of two people running down
    each other’s inner archetypes, tackling them, seducing them, cajoling
    them, waiting them out, making them talk, ‘fessing up to them, running
    from them, raping them, falling in love with some, hating others, getting to
    know some, making friends with some, hanging some in the closet on each
    other’s hooks - hooks on which hang fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers,
    other loves, idols, fantasies, maybe even past lives, and true mythological
    consciousness that sometimes come to life within one with such force that we
    feel a thread that goes hack thousands of years, even to other realms of
    being.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this is what we &quot;marry&quot; in the other, a process that goes
    on while we manage to earn a living, go to the movies, watch television, go
    to the doctor, walk on ‘the Palisades, drive to Texas, follow the
    election, try to stop drinking, eat too much Haagen Dazs.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, if two people are completely oblivious to this level of life,
    they cannot live consciously on this level of life. If one person is
    oblivious, life can’t he lived at this pitch. (Though this is a level that
    works its ways whether or not you are aware of it; it is, in Lawrence
    Durrell’s phrase, &quot;the life of your life,&quot; and most people
    thrash around on its surface, the puppets of their needs, hardly guessing.)
    If two people are in competition with each other, then this sort of
    responsibility toward each other’s inners cannot occur. (This sense of
    women and men in competition is a common notion now, and I don’t
    necessarily mean career competition, nor do I mean that people pursuing the
    same careers are necessarily in competition.) Nor can life be lived at this
    pitch if one person is trying to tame the other. Nor can it occur if people
    are trying to live up to an ideology, whether it is a Christianist ideology,
    an &quot;it’s-time-to-live-happily-ever-after&quot; ideology, or a
    &quot;liberated man/liberated woman&quot; ideology. Sooner or later your
    wife is going to come prancing through the living room with the flayed
    undead carcass of her ex-husband or her lost father, and you’re going to
    be slipping on their psychic slime, and watch out, mama’s boy, that bitch
    wants to dance, to dance with her horror, and you better he able to give her
    something more present than a Marxist or new age or fundamentalist ideology.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With volatile people much of this is surprisingly out front, given the eyes
    to see it, But the same stuff goes down with sedate, quiet couples. It just
    happens more undercover, and is harder to spot. Worse than harder to spot,
    it’s harder to feel, because it’s not so specific. But it is, after all,
    the mannerly Anglo-Saxon peoples who started a new religion partly to
    institute divorce and who fought hundreds of years of religious wars partly
    to keep a Protestantism that allowed divorce. It is their descendants in
    America who have largely made divorce a legal institution. Even so, roughly
    a third of the murders that occur in America take place within families.
    These forces can remain unknown, but they are never unfelt.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistically, there are many more violent crimes per capita within families
    in the United States than there are in any other nation. When you consider
    that this is the nation most responsible for the stability of the world’s
    economy and that this nation - these families - elect leaders who have
    the power to end all life on this planet, you may agree with me that this
    issue of what might constitute a dynamically sane marriage is as crucial as
    wars in the Third World, economic justice, and nuclear survival. These
    situations are certainly and umbilically linked.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which brings me to my <span style="background-color: #FEFFE1">main point</span>:<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> there may be no more important project of
    our time than displacing Christianist fiction of monopersonality. This
    fiction is the notion that each person has a central and unified
    &quot;I&quot; which determines his or her acts.</span> &quot;I&quot; have been
    writing this to say that I don't think people experience life that way. I do
    think they experience language that way, and hence are doomed to speak about
    life in structures contrary to their experience. This contributes to the
    pervasive and impotent sense of bafflement that very quickly can turn to
    violence.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage, for instance. Our conventional concept of marriage came out of the
    life of feudal Europe, a life so strictured that it likely evoked only two

    thinkers and artists of the time knew most of what we know about the psyche
    - their cathedrals prove it. And the worshipers had a virtual chorus line
    of saints they could react to with their various selves. But they worked six
    days a week, they went to bed at dark, they were married and often had
    families by the time they were fifteen, and their life span was often not
    much more than forty years. Except for the church and the holidays, there
    were next to no external stimuli outside of the daily grind. We are still
    speaking their language. We are still structuring thoughts - envisioning
    reality - with their grammar. But our lives are totally different.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern society can be defined as a barrage of stimuli haphazardly evoking
    many conflicting selves daily in every individual. These selves - as our
    art proves, from the Pyramids to Homer, from the Bible to Chartres and the
    present - have always been alive and only restlessly asleep in our race;
    now they’ve been awakened by a cacophony of concurrent and constant
    calls. Yet most Western thought - most psychology, socio-economic theory
    (both leftist and rightist), feminist theory, to name a few - labor under
    a model of the human personality as outdated for contemporary life as
    Newtonian physics was to relativity physics.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This meditation on marriage has been based on another model of the psyche
    entirely: the notion that we have not a single center, but several centers;
    that each of these centers may act independently of each other; and that
    each center has in turn various active aspects, or shadings; and that alt
    these centers are unified more by an
    atmosphere, an overall mood and rhythm, than by anything as stolid as a
    &quot;central command post&quot; called an &quot;ego&quot; or whatever.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a central awareness; but awareness us not control. Confusing
    awareness with control is the mistake Western thought has been making for
    centuries. It is tempting to call this awareness many things - one’s
    ego, one’s character, one’s personality - but those words are just
    screens onto which we can project what we most need and want to be,
    projections that change depending on which inner self we are expressing and
    acting out at the moment. </p>
		<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new model of the psyche must take this unifying
    urge into account, and presume that its impulse is fundamental to us; but a
    new model of the psyche must go beyond this impulse and envision the inner
    multiplicity which this impulse strains to unify. It’s as though the
    reason this impulse is so strong is that there’s so much within the
    individual to unify. For too Long Western thought has mistaken the impulse
    to unify for the entity itself (the psyche) that needs such an impulse
    because of its very multiplicity. The central &quot;I&quot; is not a fact,
    it s a longing - the longing of all the selves within the psyche that are
    starving because they are not recognized.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This notion is certainly not original with me. You can find it, in various
    forms, in the novels of Doris Lessing and Lawrence Durrell, in the teachings
    of the Sufis and the Zens, in the art of Picasso and Bosch, in the poems of
    Ovid and Lorca, in the writings of Gurdjieff and Laing and Jung and
    Marie-Louise von Franz: and James Hillman. Here is a passage of Laing’s
    Politics of Experience that get at it in terms similar to and possibly
    clearer than mine:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="left"><i>&quot;Consider the
      rnetamorphoses that one man may go through in one day as he moves from one
      mode of sociality to another - family man, speck of crowd dust,
      functionary at an organization, friend. These are not simply different
      roles: each is a whole past and present and future, offering different
      options and constraints, different kinds of closeness and distance,
      different sets of rights and obligations, different pledges and
      promises.&quot;</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><i>I know of no theory of
      the individual that fully recognizes this. There is every temptation to
      start with a notion of some supposed basic personality, but halo, effects
      are not reducible to one internal system. The tired family man at the
      office and the tired businessman at home attest to the fact that people
      carry over not just one set of internal objects, hut various internalized
      social modes of being, from one context to another.&quot;</i> (Laing’s
      emphasis.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My description, as compared to Laing’s, is, well, more Catholic than
    Protestant, more the Tarot than the I Ching. No matter. The important thing
    - as important, I believe, as relativity proved to be (indeed this may be
    the only way we can cope with relativity) - is that 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">many are at the
    beginning of a theory of personality that will gradually overwhelm the monopersonality model that still warps the West’s vision</span>, for that is a
    model as inadequate to a more accurate perception and experience of what we
    are as Newton’s mechanical-universe model was for charting any but the
    grossest, most obvious movements of the universe.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is crucial to every form of human effort that we forge a model of the
    psyche that is closer to our hour-to-hour experience, because, in the long
    run, as a society, we can share only what we can express. Our institutions
    don’t match our experience, and that is causing chaos on a world scale. It
    is likely that these institutions won’t match our experience until we can
    articulate our experience in more accurately contemporary terms. Marriage is
    only one of those institutions.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard walking away down the road at
    the end of Modern Times? They’re broke. They’re vulnerable to any
    circumstance. Their walk is almost a dance. They’re on their way. That’s
    the image of marriage that keeps this married man going. For us, marriage is
    a journey toward an unknown destination. The &quot;solace&quot; possible is
    to be reasonably certain you’re not going backward, not uselessly covering
    the same terrain again and again, not circling one another in one place.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, of course, you find yourself walking backward, facing where you’ve
    been, blind to where you’re going - interesting, disorienting, and
    infuriating, but it happens. Sometimes you’re pushing each over impossibly
    steep, sheer terrain. The metaphors, from this point on, could be as endless
    as the road. The important thing seems to be not to kid ourselves about the
    destination. We don’t know it. It is not &quot;security,&quot; which is
    impossible to achieve on planet Earth in the latter half of the twentieth
    century. </p>
		<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not &quot;happiness,&quot; by which we generally mean nothing
    but giddy forgetfulness about the dangers of all our lives together. It is
    not &quot;self realization,&quot; by which people usually mean a separate
    peace. There is no separate peace. - &quot;While there is a soul in prison,
    I am not free,&quot; said Eugene Debs once upon a time, and that goes for
    all sorts of prisons, psychic as well as walled, and it’s as true if you’re
    married as if you’re not. Getting married won’t stop it from being true.
    Until we accept the fact that technology has married us all, has made us one
    people on one planet, and until we are more courageous about that larger
    marriage, there will he no peace, and the destination of any of us, married
    or not, will be unknown.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission of marriage in our age is to live out the question: how far can
    men and women go together? Because they must go wherever it is they are
    going together. There is no such thing as going alone. Given the doings and
    the structure of the psyche, there is no such thing as being alone. If you
    are the only one in the room, it is still a crowded room.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage creates a field between two people in which these issues can he
    lived out, lived through. This, of course, happens or tries to happen
    wilIy-nilly in any serious connection between people; but it is the focus
    and inner mission of marriage. That is the danger of marriage, and its very
    danger is its hope and the measure of its importance.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sense, marriage is on the cutting edge of this culture now as it may
    never have been before. What men and women may or may not become is being
    tested in its crucible.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So … I get up to look for matches for my cigar before I re-read all this
    and send it in, and Jan says, &quot;I hope it’s not like the first
    draft.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I hope they know we laugh sometimes.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In laughter my writing is weakest, and she knows this better than anyone.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We laugh a lot,&quot; I say.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not in the first draft.&quot;</p>
