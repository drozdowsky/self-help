<p align="center"><b><u>What I Have Learned</u>...<br>
</b><br>
I've learned that you cannot make someone love you.<br>
All you can do is be someone who can be loved.<br>
The rest is up to them.<br>
<br>
I've learned that no matter how much I care,<br>
some people just don't care back.<br>
<br>
I've learned that it takes years to build up trust,<br>
and only seconds to destroy it.<br>
<br>
I've learned that you can get by on charm for about<br>
fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better know something.<br>
<br>
I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to<br>
the best others can do, but to the best you can do.<br>
<br>
I've learned that it's not what happens to people<br>
that's important. It's what they do about it.<br>
<br>
I've learned that no matter how thin you slice it,<br>
there are always two sides.<br>
<br>
I've learned that it's taking me a long time<br>
to become the person I want to be<br>
<br>
I've learned that it's a lot easier to react than it is to think.<br>
<br>
I've learned that you should always leave loved ones<br>
with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.<br>
<br>
I've learned that you can keep going<br>
long after you think you can't.<br>
<br>
I've learned that we are responsible for what we do,<br>
no matter how we feel.<br>
<br>
I've learned that either you control your attitude<br>
or it controls you.<br>
<br>
I've learned that heroes are the people who do<br>
what has to be done when it needs to be done,<br>
regardless of the consequences.<br>
<br>
I've learned that learning to forgive takes practice.<br>
<br>
I've learned that there are people who love you dearly,<br>
but just don't know how to show it.<br>
<br>
I've learned that money is a lousy way of keeping score.<br>
<br>
I've learned that my best friend and I can do<br>
anything or nothing and have the best time.<br>
<br>
I've learned that sometimes the people you expect<br>
to kick you when you're down will be<br>
the ones to help you get back up.<br>
<br>
I've learned that true friendship continues to grow,<br>
even over the longest distance. Same goes for true love.<br>
<br>
I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you<br>
the way you want them to doesn't mean<br>
they don't love you with all they have.<br>
<br>
I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types<br>
of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them,<br>
and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.<br>
<br>
I've learned that you should never tell a child<br>
their dreams are unlikely or outlandish.<br>
Few things are more humiliating, and<br>
what a tragedy it would be if they believed it.<br>
<br>
I've learned that your family won't always be there for you.<br>
It may seem funny, but people you aren't related to can<br>
take care of you and love you and teach you to trust people again.<br>
Families aren't biological.<br>
<br>
I've learned that no matter how good a friend is,<br>
they're going to hurt you every once in a while<br>
and you must forgive them for that.<br>
<br>
I've learned that it isn't always enough to be forgiven by others.<br>
Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself.<br>
<br>
I've learned that no matter how bad your heart is broken<br>
the world doesn't stop for your grief.<br>
<br>
I've learned that our background and circumstances may have<br>
influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.<br>
<br>
I've learned that just because two people argue,<br>
it doesn't mean they don't love each other And just<br>
because they don't argue, it doesn't mean they do.<br>
<br>
I've learned that sometimes you have to put<br>
the individual ahead of their actions.<br>
<br>
I've learned that we don't have to change friends<br>
if we understand that friends change.<br>
<br>
I've learned that two people can look at the exact same thing<br>
and see something totally different.<br>
<br>
I've learned that there are many ways of falling and staying in love.<br>
<br>
I've learned that no matter the consequences,<br>
those who are honest with themselves get farther in life.<br>
<br>
I've learned that your life can be changed in a matter of hours<br>
by people who don't even know you.<br>
<br>
I've learned that even when you think you have no more to give,<br>
when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.<br>
<br>
I've learned that writing, as well as talking,<br>
can ease emotional pains.<br>
<br>
I've learned that the paradigm we live in<br>
is not all that is offered to us.<br>
<br>
I've learned that credentials on the wall<br>
do not make you a decent human being.<br>
<br>
I've learned that the people you care most about in life<br>
are taken from you too soon.<br>
<br>
I've learned that although the word &quot;love&quot;<br>
can have many different meanings,<br>
it loses value when overly used.<br>
<br>
I've learned that it's hard to determine where to draw the line<br>
between being nice and not hurting people's feelings<br>
and standing up for what you believe.<br>
